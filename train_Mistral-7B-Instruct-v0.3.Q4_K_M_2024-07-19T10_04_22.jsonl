Each row corresponds to a field on the form.\n3. Use the SET statement to set the values of each field based on data from a database or other sources.\n4. Render the generated HTML using the HTML_OUT function in the script.\n\nHere's an example: Suppose you have a table with employee information and you want to display it in a dynamic HTML table. You could use the following script:\n```\ndeclare\n    ln_counter : integer;\nend declares;\n\nset ln_counter = 0;\ninsert into HTML_OUT\nselect * from Employees order by lastname, firstname;\n\nfor each row in cursors.employees\nbegin\n    set cell(\"ln\" || ln_counter, 0, cursors.employees[\"lastname\"]);\n    set cell(\"ln\" || ln_counter, 1, cursors.employees[\"firstname\"]);\n    // Add more cells with other employee details as needed\n    increment ln_counter;\nend;\n```\nIn this example, the INSERT INTO statement is used to insert each row from the Employees table into the HTML_OUT function. The FOR EACH loop is then used to iterate through the rows and set the values of each cell in the HTML table based on the data from the database. This generates a dynamic HTML table that displays employee information, which can be refreshed whenever new data is added to the database."}
