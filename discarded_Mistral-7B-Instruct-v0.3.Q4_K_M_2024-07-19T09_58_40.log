2024-07-19T10:23:58 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Handles, and what advantages do they offer for managing multiple procedures within a program?\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD Procedure Handles (Prochandle Objects), a ProcHandle object represents a running procedure. By using ProcHandle objects, you can execute procedures asynchronously, transfer control between different procedures, and manage multiple procedures more efficiently within a single program. The advantages include better organization, simplified error handling, and improved code reusability compared to traditional procedural calling techniques.\n'

How can that be achieved?\n\n** Input\nLet's say we have a procedure named 'my_procedure' and inside this, there is a SQL statement we need to run. We want to achieve this by creating a ProcHandle object.\n```sql\ncreate procedure my_procedure()\nbegin\n    declare\n        proc_handle = ProcHandle;\n    enddeclare\n\n    -- Define the SQL statement\n    sql_stmt = 'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = \\'USA\\';';\n\n    -- Create a ProcHandle object for the SQL statement\n    proc_handle = CurSession.Scope.GetProcHandle(name = 'EXEC SQL STATEMENT');\n\n    -- Assign the SQL statement to the ProcHandle object\n    proc_handle.Parameters(1).Value = sql_stmt;\n\n    -- Execute the ProcHandle object\n    proc_handle.Execute();\nend;\n```\n\n"

However, it may require additional setup and management compared to the default error-handling mechanisms in the language. Furthermore, since ProcHandle objects are tied to specific procedures or functions, they might not be as flexible when handling errors across multiple parts of your codebase.\n'

The procedure will receive these values when it's called using the `Call()` method on the ProcHandle object.\n"
