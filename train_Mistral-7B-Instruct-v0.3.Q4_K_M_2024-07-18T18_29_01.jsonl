After creating a group identifier \"dev\\_team\" with the appropriate members, you can grant them the required privilege as follows:\n\n```sql\ngrant alter_table_privilege to dev_team;\n```\nThis statement grants the `ALTER_TABLE_PRIVILEGE` to all the users associated with the \"dev\\_team\" group identifier.
