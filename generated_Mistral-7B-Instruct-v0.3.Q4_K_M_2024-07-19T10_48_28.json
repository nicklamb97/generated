For instance, if you declare a variable `myVar char(3)`, it can store strings of up to 3 characters only. Any additional characters will be truncated.\n- On the other hand, the `varchar` data type is a variable length string data type. It can store strings of varying lengths and automatically adjusts its size based on the stored value's actual length.\n\nBoth char and varchar have client-side coercion and server-side coercion capabilities.

Instead, use the LongVcharObject system class as an alternative for large string storage.\n4. nchar / nvarchar - These data types are used for storing fixed-length strings with a specific character encoding, like Unicode or ASCII, but they are not commonly used due to OpenROAD's transparent Unicode support. In modern applications, using the varchar data type with UTF8 encoding is sufficient.\n\nThese character data types store string values and have their intrinsic data types and built-in scalar objects defined in OpenROAD.

        "output": "In OpenROAD Actian 4GL, the `decimal` data type is a numeric data type used to store fractional values with a specific precision and scale. It is useful when you need to perform arithmetic operations on monetary values or other decimal numbers that require a high level of accuracy.\n\nThe `decimal` data type allows you to define the total number of digits (precision) and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point (scale). For example, if you declare a variable `myVar decimal(8, 2)`, it can store numbers with up to 8 digits in total and 2 digits after the decimal point. This data type supports client-side coercion and server-side coercion, making it easy to perform arithmetic operations involving other numeric types like integers or floats.",

On the other hand, the `varchar` type doesn't have a fixed length. It can store varying lengths of string data efficiently due to its dynamic nature.
