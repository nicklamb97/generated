What technique should you use?\n** Output\nTo correctly read data from a CSV file with quotes while handling commas within those quoted fields in Actian 4GL, you can utilize the `CSV_PARSE` built-in function. The function takes two arguments: the first is the field containing the CSV string, and the second is a delimiter for specifying what character separates individual fields.\n\nHere\'s an example of how to use it:\n```\nopen input_file using "/path/to/your/input_file";\nfor line = 1 to size(input_file) do begin\n    fetch next input_file into :line;\n    field := CSV_PARSE(line, \',\');\n    display \'Field 1: \', field[1];\n    display \'Field 2: \', field[2];\n    -- Assuming two fields for simplicity\nend for;\nclose input_file;\n```\nThis example assumes that the CSV file has two fields separated by commas. You can adjust the number of fields accordingly, and access each field using its index within the `field` array variable returned by the `CSV_PARSE()` function.\n'
