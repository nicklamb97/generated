            "# The `resume` statement in Actian 4GL\n\nThe resume statement in Actian OpenROAD 6.2 ends the currently executing event block and can be used in different ways to control the flow of events.\n\n## Syntax\n```4gl\nresume [next];\n```\n\n## Usage\n### Without the next Keyword\n- Ends the current operation.\n- Repositions the input focus on the screen at the field designated in CurFrame.InputFocusField.\n### With the next Keyword\n- Gives control to the next pending event that was triggered by the original action in the event block.\n\n## Behavior\n### Omitting the next Keyword\n- The field designated in the InputFocusField attribute is the field that last had the input focus when the event block was activated.\n- You can force control to resume to a specific field by explicitly setting the InputFocusField attribute of the FrameExec object to the desired field.\n### Handling Multiple Events\n- User actions can trigger more than one event. If the next keyword is not used, these events are discarded.\n- Example: If a user tabs between two entry fields, A and B, with an Exit event for A and an Entry event for B, a resume statement in the Exit event block will position the cursor on field A and discard the Entry event for field B. A resume next statement will position the cursor on field B and process the Entry event for B.\n \n## Event Chains and Event Processing\nFor detailed information on event chains and event processing, refer to the Programming Guide.\n\n### Database and User Events\n- A resume statement never discards pending database events and usually does not discard user events.\n- Exception: If a SendUserEvent call sets the focus behavior of the current field in the receiving frame to FT_SETVALUE or FT_TAKEFOCUS, and a preceding event block executes a resume statement (without next), the rest of the chain, including the user event, is discarded.\n\n## Placement of the resume Statement\n- Typically the last statement in an event block or in the statement list of an if statement.\n- Statements following a resume statement are not executed.\n- Often used in a SetValue validation if the condition fails.\n\n## Use in Procedures\n- Can be used in local or global procedures.\n- Terminates the currently executing event block and all procedures above it in the call stack until a frame is found.\n- If no currently executing event block exists, the application is terminated.\n\n## Examples\n### Example 1: Resume Control Based on Field Value\nAssume you have four fields on a form: testfield, field1, field2, and field3:\n\n```4gl\non exit testfield =\nbegin\n    if testfield = 2 then\n        CurFrame.InputFocusField = field(field2);\n        resume;\n    elseif testfield = 3 then\n        CurFrame.InputFocusField = field(field3);\n        resume;\n    endif;\n    /* processing statements for field1 */\nend\n```\n- Control resumes on field2 if testfield is 2, and on field3 if testfield is 3.\n- For any other value, control resumes on field1 if the user tries to tab out of the field.\n\n## Example 2: Validate Field and Reposition Input Focus\nReposition input focus on the vendor_num field with an error message if the current field contents are not valid:\n\n```4gl\non setvalue vendor_num =\nbegin\n    select vendornum as tvnum\n        from vendor\n        where vendornum = :vendor_num;\n    if iirowcount = 0 then\n        message 'Vendor does not exist.';\n        resume;\n    endif;\nend\n```\n- If the vendor_num does not exist in the vendor table, an error message is displayed and control is resumed on the vendor_num field."
