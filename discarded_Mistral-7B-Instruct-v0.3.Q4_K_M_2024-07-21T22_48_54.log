Respond only in text:\n```csharp\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    // Database operations\n}\n```\n** Output\nThe `using` statement in C# provides a mechanism for managing the disposal of resources that implement the IDisposable interface, such as database connections or file streams. It ensures that the resources are properly disposed when they're no longer needed by automatically calling the `Dispose()` method at the end of the scope of the using block. This helps to prevent memory leaks and simplifies resource management, as you don't have to remember to call `Dispose()` manually.\n\n"

Respond with a list of at least 5 potential issues that may arise during the conversion process.\n** Output\n1. Differences in syntax: Actian 4GL and C# have different syntaxes, which might require understanding and rewriting certain parts of the code.\n2. Lack of direct equivalent functions: Some functions available in Actian 4GL do not have direct counterparts in C#, requiring alternative solutions to achieve similar functionalities.\n3. Handling exceptions: Exceptions are handled differently in both languages, necessitating proper handling and conversion strategies for error cases.\n4. Performance considerations: Depending on the specific codebase, there could be performance differences between the two languages, which may need to be addressed during the conversion process.\n5. Learning curve for new developers: If developers are not familiar with both Actian 4GL and C#, they may face a learning curve while converting and optimizing the code to work efficiently in the target language.'

Integer: In C#, it\'s `int`. In 4GL, it\'s represented by `i` or `z` depending on whether signed or unsigned is required.\n2. Double/Float (floating-point): In C#, it\'s `double`. In 4GL, you can use `float` for single precision floating point numbers and `real` for double precision.\n3. String: In both languages, a string is represented by a sequence of characters. In C#, you can define strings using either single or double quotes like `string s = "Hello"` or `string t = "World";`. In 4GL, a string starts with the double quote (") and ends with another double quote, like `dim s as char *100 = "Hello";`.\n4. Boolean: In C#, it\'s `bool`, where true and false are represented by True and False in 4GL.\n5. Date/Time: In both languages, you can work with dates and times. In C#, use the `DateTime` data type (e.g., `DateTime now = DateTime.Now;`). In 4GL, date and time are represented using timestamps. You can find the current timestamp using `GET_TIMESTAMP()`.'

Mismatched data types: Actian 4GL and C# have different data types. Ensure proper conversion of data types during the conversion process.\n3. Inconsistent naming conventions: Follow .NET naming conventions when converting variable names and function/method names from Actian 4GL to C#.\n4. Handling database connections: Properly manage and dispose of database connections in your C# code, as they are not automatically handled like in Actian 4GL.\n5. Incorrect conversion of SQL commands: Carefully convert SQL commands used in Actian 4GL into their C# equivalents using appropriate libraries, such as Dapper or Entity Framework.\n\nThese pitfalls can lead to runtime errors, unexpected behavior, and potential security vulnerabilities during the conversion process. Addressing these issues will help ensure a smooth transition from Actian 4GL code to C#.\n"

Respond in a detailed and helpful manner with an example of converting a simple loop structure.\n\n** Input\n<noinput>\n\n** Output\nA recommended approach for converting loops and logic structures from Actian 4GL code to C# is to translate the 4GL code into C# counterparts using the corresponding C# language constructs. In this example, we will convert a simple loop that reads a recordset in 4GL to an equivalent C# `foreach` loop for reading elements of a List<T>.\n\nLet\'s say you have a simple loop in Actian 4GL that retrieves and iterates through a set of records (product_id, product_name) from the products table:\n\n```4gl\nDEFINE VAR product_id AS INTEGER NO-UNDO.\nDEFINE VAR product_name AS CHARACTER LENGTH 50 NO-UNDO.\nFETCH PRODUCTS INTO :product_id, :product_name USING RECORDSET.\nWHILE CURRENT OF recordset DO\n    DISPLAY "Product ID: ", :product_id, " - Product Name: ", :product_name.\n    ADVANCE RECORDSET.\nEND WHILE.\n```\n\nYou can convert the 4GL code into an equivalent C# loop as follows:\n\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT product_id, product_name FROM products", connection))\n    {\n        using (var reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n        {\n            if (reader.HasRows)\n            {\n                while (reader.Read())\n                {\n                    // Access the data for each record with the name of its column.\n                    int productId = (int)reader["product_id"];\n                    string productName = reader["product_name"].ToString();\n\n                    Console.WriteLine($"Product ID: {productId} - Product Name: {productName}");\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```'

Here\'s how you can achieve it using the provided example:\n\nFirst, you will need to create a method that retrieves the employees based on the query:\n\n```csharp\nusing System.Collections.Generic;\nusing System.Data;\nusing System.Data.Common;\n\npublic IEnumerable<Employee> GetSortedEmployees()\n{\n    var employees = new List<Employee>();\n    using (var connection = new SqlConnection("YourConnectionString"))\n    {\n        var command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY Salary DESC", connection);\n        connection.Open();\n        var reader = command.ExecuteReader();\n\n        while (reader.Read())\n        {\n            employees.Add(new Employee()\n            {\n                Id = reader.GetInt32(0),\n                Name = reader.GetString(1),\n                Salary = reader.GetDecimal(2)\n            });\n        }\n    }\n\n    return employees;\n}\n```\nNow, you can utilize the `foreach` loop to iterate through the sorted list of employees and print their salaries:\n\n```csharp\nvar sortedEmployees = GetSortedEmployees();\nforeach (var employee in sortedEmployees)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(employee.Salary);\n}\n```\nThis example demonstrates how to efficiently perform iterations using an iterator-based approach in C# by using the `foreach` loop, which iterates through a collection and calls the `GetSortedEmployees()` method to fetch the sorted list of employees based on their salaries.\n\n'

This approach allows for a more organized, modular exception handling process in C#, as multiple error scenarios can be handled within the same catch block or by creating specific catch blocks for different types of exceptions.\n'
