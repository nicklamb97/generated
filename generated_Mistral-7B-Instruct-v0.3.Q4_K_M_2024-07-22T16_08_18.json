To handle the case when the updated salary is less than the minimum wage in the above scenario:\n1. Declare a handler for warnings at the beginning of the procedure:\n```sql\ndeclare warning handler on update_salary(msg string);\n```\n2. Add error handling code within the procedure to handle the specific error:\n```sql\nprocedure update_salary(input integer emp_id, input float new_salary);\nbegin\n    if (new_salary < 7.25) then // Minimum wage in the USA\n        raise warning \"Updated salary is below the minimum wage.\";\n    else\n        update employees set salary = :new_salary where employee_id = :emp_id;\n        handle on update_salary(msg string);\n            message msg;\n            if (substring(msg, 1, length(\"Updated salary is below the minimum wage.\")) = \"Updated salary is below the minimum wage.\") then\n                message \"Salary updated with a warning.\";\n            else\n                message \"Unexpected error occurred: \" + msg;\n            endif;\n        endhandle;\n    endif;\nend;\n``` This way, you can handle specific errors and return meaningful messages to the user when they occur.",
