The syntax remains the same: `[returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];`, where `procname` is the name of your external 3GL procedure.

Define the method containing the Callproc statement. For example:\n```\nmethod callFortranProcedure;\n  declare i as integer;\n  callproc myfortranProcedure(i);\nend;\n```\n2. Implement the FORTRAN procedure. Make sure it's compiled and linked to your OpenROAD application. The prototype for the external function should resemble: `external subroutine myfortranProcedure(i as integer)`.\n3. Call the method from a frame or another procedure whenever needed. For example:\n```\nframe mainFrame;\n  declare obj as myUserClassType;\n  open obj using \"my_user_class\";\n  call obj.callFortranProcedure(5);\nend;\n```\n4. In the FORTRAN procedure, accept an integer value from the Callproc statement and manipulate or process it according to your requirements."}

If the return type is not explicitly specified in the documentation or known, consult the code of the called procedure to determine its return type. For example, if the called procedure returns an integer value, use a variable of data type `integer` as the return variable."}

The procedure name you use for `procname` must match the name in the procedure's definition. If you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "When should we use the 'byref(variable)' option while using the Callproc statement in Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "The `byref(variable)` option must be used when passing values by reference to a 4GL or 3GL procedure with the callproc statement. This is necessary to allow the called procedure to update the value of the variable in the calling frame or procedure. For example, if you want to pass a parameter and also have it updated upon return, you would use `byref(variable)`."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What happens when we do not specify 'returnvariable' while using the Callproc Statement in Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "If you do not specify a `returnvariable` with the callproc statement, OpenROAD assumes that no return value is expected from the called procedure. This means that any return values would be discarded, and they cannot be used in the calling frame or procedure. However, some procedures may still have side effects, such as modifying variables within their scope, even if a `returnvariable` is not specified."}

This is because the Callproc Statement is meant for high-level programming language procedures (3GL), while the Execute Procedure Statement is specifically used to execute SQL statements and stored procedures defined in the database."}

The price parameter is to be updated after applying the tax percentage, whereas the tax percentage remains unchanged. To accomplish this, you'd pass the `price` variable by reference using the `byref(variable)` option while passing the `taxpercent` variable as a simple argument:\n```\ncallproc addtax(tax = taxpercent, total = byref(price));\n```\nBy doing so, the called function can update the value of the `price` variable without affecting the `taxpercent`."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Explain the difference between using an actual procedure name or a variable to represent the procedure name in Callproc Statement. Provide examples for both scenarios.", "assistant": "When you use an actual procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time and the procedure call is hard-coded into your application. On the other hand, when you use a variable to represent the procedure name, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime based on the value of the variable. For example, using an actual procedure name: `callproc MyProcedure();`. This call will always refer to the \"MyProcedure\" procedure. However, if you want to change the called procedure based on some condition or user input, use a variable:\n```sql\nset procedureName to 'UserSelectedProcedure';\ncallproc procedureName();\n```\nIn this example, `procedureName` is a variable that could be set to any valid procedure name during runtime. When the Callproc Statement is executed, it will call the procedure corresponding to the value of `procedureName`."}
