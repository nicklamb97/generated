You may use Actian OpenROAD's built-in functions such as `split()` to implement tokenization in your program.\n\n3. Filtering: Apply filters based on user input to limit the number of records that need to be scanned.

The Orders table contains columns such as order_id and customer_id. We want to delete all rows in the Orders table where the customer_id matches the provided input.", "assistant": "Here is an example of a dynamic SQL statement that deletes rows based on user input:\n```\nbegin\n    declare sql_string varchar(256);\n\n    sql_string = 'Delete from Orders Where CustomerID = :p_customer_id';\n\n    exec sql execute immediate sql_string using :p_customer_id;\nend;\n```\nIn this example, we create a dynamic SQL string that will delete all rows from the Orders table where the `CustomerID` matches the provided input. The `:p_customer_id` placeholder is then replaced with the actual value using the `using` clause in the `exec sql execute immediate` statement."}
