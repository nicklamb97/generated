It ensures that data modifications\nadhere to the defined search condition, maintaining data consistency and\nreliability within the database.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the syntax of the create integrity statement?", "assistant": "The syntax of the create integrity statement is:\n```\ncreate integrity on table_name [corr_name] is search_condition;\n```\nHere, `table_name` specifies the table for which the integrity\nconstraint is defined, `corr_name` is an optional correlation name for\nthe table, and `search_condition` defines the constraint condition that\nmust be satisfied for all rows in the table.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are the parameters available for the create integrity statement?", "assistant": "Parameters include `table_name`, `corr_name`, and `search_condition`.\nThese define the table, optional correlation name, and the condition that\nensures data integrity by restricting updates that violate the defined\nconstraint.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What permissions are required to execute the create integrity statement?", "assistant": "To execute the create integrity statement, the user must own the table\non which the integrity constraint is being defined. This permission\nensures that only authorized users can define and enforce data integrity\nrules.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does the create integrity statement affect database locking?", "assistant": "Creating an integrity constraint with the create integrity statement\ntakes an exclusive lock on the specified table. This exclusive lock\nprevents other sessions from modifying the table concurrently, ensuring\nthe integrity constraint is correctly applied during the constraint\ndefinition.\n"}
