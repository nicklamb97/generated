        "input": "",
        "output": "In both Actian 4GL and C#, you can iterate through records by using cursors or similar structures. While there are similarities, there are also some significant differences between a cursor in 4GL and a `using` block with an `IDataReader` interface in C# that impact performance, resource management, and coding style:\n\n1. **Purpose**: The primary goal of a cursor in 4GL is to provide a way to iterate through records one at a time or move between specific rows, update them, insert new ones, or delete existing records. On the other hand, C#'s `IDataReader` is used specifically for reading data from a data source and does not allow you to modify the underlying data source directly.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: A cursor in 4GL manages its own database connection. This can lead to issues such as open cursors consuming resources unnecessarily. In contrast, C#'s `using` statement ensures that the database connection is properly disposed of once the data reader is no longer needed.\n\n3. **Advantages and Potential Pitfalls**: Using a cursor in 4GL offers the flexibility to modify the underlying data source directly but can lead to performance issues due to its sequential nature and resource usage. C#'s `IDataReader` is more efficient for reading large amounts of data since it reads data forward-only and does not maintain an open connection after reading. However, if you need to update or delete records in the database, you must use a separate command object to do so.\n\n4. **Example**: Here's an example of using a cursor in 4GL:\n    ```\n    DECLARE c CURSOR FOR SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees;\n    OPEN c;\n    LOOP ON c DO\n        DISPLAY employee_id, first_name, last_name;\n    END-LOOP;\n    CLOSE c;\n    ```\nAnd here's the equivalent code using `IDataReader` in C#:\n    ```\n    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n    {\n        connection.Open();\n        using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(\"SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name FROM employees\", connection))\n        {\n            using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n            {\n                while (reader.Read())\n                {\n                    int employeeId = (int)reader[\"employee_id\"];\n                    string firstName = (string)reader[\"first_name\"];\n                    string lastName = (string)reader[\"last_name\"];\n                    Console.WriteLine(\"{0} {1}, ID: {2}\", firstName, lastName, employeeId);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    ```\nIn summary, while both cursors in 4GL and `IDataReader` in C# serve the purpose of iterating through records, they have different purposes, resource management mechanisms, advantages, potential pitfalls, and coding styles. Choosing which one to use depends on your specific requirements and context.",

You can iterate through the rows and columns using standard C# programming constructs, or use additional methods of the DataAdapter to update records in the database.\n\nFor example, to add a new row to the table before filling it into the database:\n```csharp\nDataRow row = table.NewRow();\nrow[\"flight_id\"] = someValue;\nrow[\"departure_time\"] = anotherValue;\ntable.Rows.Add(row);\nadapter.UpdateCommand = CreateUpdateCommand();  // Create an update command for the database\n```",
