Provide an example and explain how it works.\n\n** Output\n\n'DeclareBlockWithProcedures' is used to declare local variables and local procedures within a specific scope, allowing you to organize your code more effectively in OpenROAD Actian 4GL. By using 'DeclareBlockWithProcedures', you can isolate certain variables and procedures from the rest of the application.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n```\ndeclare\n    localvariable myVariable;\n    procedure myProcedure();\n        beginprocedure\n            // code block for your procedure goes here\n        endprocedure;\nenddeclare;\n```\nIn this example, `myVariable` is a local variable that will only be accessible within the 'DeclareBlockWithProcedures' scope. The local procedure `myProcedure()` will also be declared within this scope and can only be called from within it. This allows you to create reusable code blocks that won't interfere with the rest of your application.\n\n"

2024-07-19T12:58:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n1. What is the syntax for declaring local variables within a DeclareBlockWithProcedures?\nAnswer: The syntax for declaring local variables within a DeclareBlockWithProcedures in OpenROAD Actian 4GL follows the `declare <localvariable declaration>` pattern, where you define the name and data type of each variable.\n2. How do I declare a local procedure within a DeclareBlockWithProcedures?\nAnswer: To declare a local procedure within a DeclareBlockWithProcedures in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, use the `declare <localprocedure declaration>` syntax, where you define the name, parameters (if any), and body of the procedure.\n3. Can I access local variables outside of a DeclareBlockWithProcedures?\nAnswer: No, local variables declared within a DeclareBlockWithProcedures are only accessible within that specific block, and cannot be used outside of it. To make a variable available for use in other parts of your code, you should declare it using the GlobalKeyword or in an outer scope.\n4. What is the purpose of the enddeclare keyword?\nAnswer: The `enddeclare` keyword in OpenROAD Actian 4GL marks the end of a DeclareBlockWithProcedures and signals that all local variables and procedures declared within the block have been defined. This helps the system understand the boundaries of your code and prevents conflicts with other declarations.\n5. How can I call a procedure that is declared inside a DeclareBlockWithProcedures?\nAnswer: To call a procedure that is declared within a DeclareBlockWithProcedures in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, simply use the name of the procedure followed by parentheses, and any required arguments enclosed within those parentheses. If you are inside the block where the procedure was declared, you do not need to reference the block explicitly for the call. However, if you want to call the procedure from outside the block, you will need to use its full name with the block name qualifier to make the procedure accessible.'

Provide an example to illustrate the differences.\n** Output\nIn OpenROAD Actian 4GL, both global variables and local variables have their unique uses and characteristics. The main difference between them lies in their scope and accessibility:\n\n1. Global Variables: A global variable is visible throughout your entire program. This means that any part of your code can read or modify the value of a global variable. To declare a global variable, use the `global` keyword before your variable declaration instead of `local`.\n\nExample:\n```\nglobal customerCount integer = 0;\n...\n-- Any procedure in your program has access to and can modify customerCount\n```\n2. Local Variables: A local variable is only visible within a specific scope, such as a block or a procedure. This means that any code outside the scope where the local variable was declared cannot directly read or modify its value. To declare a local variable, use the `local` keyword instead of `global`.\n\nExample using DeclareBlockWithProcedures:\n```\ndeclare\n    procedure countCustomers();\n        -- This procedure only has access to local variables defined within it.\n        local customerCount integer = 0;\n        -- Code that increments the local variable for each customer found goes here.\n    endprocedure countCustomers;\n...\n-- The main program cannot directly access customerCount, but can call the countCustomers procedure to get its value.\n```\nIn summary, while global variables are accessible from anywhere within your program, local variables help maintain code organization by limiting their scope and only allowing access within a specific block or procedure. This can make it easier for others (or future versions of yourself) to understand and manage the code.\n'

Use `localproceduredeclaration` syntax to define the procedure.\n2. Define the input parameters within parentheses, separating them with commas.\n3. Inside the local procedure's body, use `argumentname` to access and manipulate the input parameters.\n\nHere is an example demonstrating how to declare a local procedure that accepts arguments and performs a simple calculation using the provided inputs:\n```\ndeclare\n    localprocedure addNumbers(arg1 int, arg2 int) integer;\n        beginprocedure addNumbers;\n            integer sum = arg1 + arg2;\n            message 'The result of adding ', arg1, ' and ', arg2, ' is: ', sum;\n        endprocedure addNumbers;\n    enddeclare;\n```\nIn this example, the local procedure `addNumbers()` accepts two integers as input arguments, `arg1` and `arg2`. Within its body, these arguments are used to perform an addition operation and store the result in a variable called `sum`. Finally, the resulting value is displayed using the 'message' statement. To call this local procedure, you can use a function like this:\n```\ndeclare\n    beginprocedure main();\n        call addNumbers(5, 7);\n    endprocedure main;\nenddeclare;\n```\n"
