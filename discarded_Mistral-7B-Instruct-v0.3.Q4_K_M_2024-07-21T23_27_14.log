Provide an example of using exception handling for each scenario mentioned above.\n** Output\nTo handle exceptions in C# during the conversion process from Actian 4GL code, you can use the try-catch block to wrap the critical code blocks that may potentially throw exceptions. The catch block will then process the exception and perform appropriate actions such as displaying an error message or recovering the system state if possible. Here are examples of exception handling for each scenario:\n1. Invalid character:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Replace "<|" with "&lt;&lt;" to avoid the "Invalid character" error when converting strings from 4GL to C#\n    string invalidCharString = "<|>".Replace("<|", "&lt;&lt;");\n}\ncatch (System.ArgumentException exception)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine("Error: {0}", exception.Message);\n}\n```\n2.

Incorrect data types:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    int invalidValue = Convert.ToInt32(invalidData); // Replace "invalidData" with a string value from 4GL code that may have incorrect data type\n}\ncatch (InvalidCastException exception)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine("Error: The data has an incorrect data type and cannot be cast to the specified type.");\n}\n```\nThese examples demonstrate how you can use exception handling in C# to manage errors during the conversion process from Actian 4GL code. Proper error handling is crucial for maintaining a stable system, especially when working with data conversions between different programming languages or tools.\n'

Handling nullable values: Be aware that C# doesn't have a direct equivalent of the ALPHABETIC, NO ZEROS data type in Actian 4GL. Make sure to handle nullable values appropriately by using nullable types in C# or performing checks for missing values.\n2. Handling errors and exceptions: Error handling in Actian 4GL differs from that in C#. To ensure proper error management, implement exception handling mechanisms in your C# code, such as `try-catch` blocks.\n3. Differences in control structures: While both languages support loops and conditional statements, there can be subtle differences between their syntax and behavior. Be familiar with the equivalent constructs in both languages to avoid mistakes when converting code.\n4. Data conversion: Some data types may not have a direct mapping between Actian 4GL and C#. Ensure that you properly convert data types, including nullable ones, using appropriate methods such as `Parse` or `TryParse`.\n5. Naming conventions: Maintain consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and procedures to make the code more readable and easier to understand for others.\n6.

Code organization in C# is usually based on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, where classes represent objects, and their methods describe the actions that can be performed by those objects. Here\'s an example of C# code structure:\n```csharp\nusing System;\n\nnamespace MyNamespace\n{\n    public class MyClass\n    {\n        private readonly string decl1; // Private member declaration\n        private int decl2;             // Member declaration without access modifier, which makes it internal by default\n\n        public MyClass() // Constructor\n        {\n            this.decl1 = "Default value"; // Initialization of a private member in the constructor\n        }\n\n        public void MyMethod() // Method definition\n        {\n            ...\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nFor code reuse in C#, you can create methods or classes that perform specific tasks and then use them across multiple files, providing a more modular structure. Actian 4GL allows you to define procedures and functions, which have some similarities with C# methods; however, they are not as flexible when it comes to encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism – key concepts in OOP that make code reuse more efficient.\n\nTo achieve better code organization and reusability when converting from Actian 4GL to C#, consider refactoring your existing procedures into classes and methods according to best practices for OOP. This will improve maintainability, scalability, and readability of your converted code.'

For example, consider a `Car` class:\n```csharp\npublic class Car\n{\n    public string Brand { get; set; }\n    public int Year { get; set; }\n    public double Speed { get; set; }\n\n    public void Accelerate(double speedIncrement)\n    {\n        Speed += speedIncrement;\n    }\n}\n```\nTo create an object (an instance) of the `Car` class, you would write:\n```csharp\nvar myCar = new Car\n{\n    Brand = "Tesla",\n    Year = 2021,\n    Speed = 0\n};\nmyCar.Accelerate(10); // Increases the car\'s speed by 10\n```\nIn this example, we define a `Car` class with properties like `Brand`, `Year`, and `Speed`. We also create a method called `Accelerate` that increments the car\'s speed. Once defined, we can create an object (an instance of the `Car` class) named `myCar`. This object has its own state (properties and methods) and can be used to represent an individual car within the program.\n'

This helps improve readability and maintenance of the code.\n- Keep methods short and focused on a single responsibility. Splitting large functions into smaller ones makes the code easier to understand and test.\n- Use comments sparingly to explain complex sections of code or areas that require special attention.\n- Handle exceptions properly by using try-catch blocks instead of letting unhandled exceptions crash your application.\n- Optimize performance by using efficient algorithms, reducing unnecessary memory usage, and avoiding expensive operations when possible.\n- Write testable code by breaking up the logic into smaller, testable units that can be isolated and tested independently. This helps catch bugs earlier in the development process.\n- Maintain a consistent coding style within your project to make it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code.'
