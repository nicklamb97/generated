The loop displays each integer from 1 to 3 using the `MESSAGE` statement and increments the counter variable with each iteration. After displaying a message, the sleep statement is called, pausing execution for 2 seconds before moving on to the next loop iteration. This continues until all three numbers have been displayed, resulting in a 6-second pause between messages.\n\n'
