Avoid using wildcard characters (e.g., \"%\" or \"_\") at the beginning of a search pattern since it may cause excessive scans and slow down query execution.\n3. Minimize the use of subqueries as they can impact performance significantly. Instead, try to rewrite them as joins for better performance.\n4. Use the EXISTS operator instead of IN with large sets when checking for existence within a table.\n5. Minimize the number of JOIN operations in a query by reducing the complexity or breaking up larger queries into smaller ones if needed.\n6. Limit the result set size by applying filters early in the WHERE clause to reduce the amount of data processed and returned.\n7. Use COUNT(*) instead of COUNT(columnName) when counting rows since it's faster for large tables with a primary key index.\n8. When using aggregations (e.g., SUM, AVG), avoid using GROUP BY columns containing a high number of distinct values since it increases the time to group data.\n9. Use views when the same query is frequently used or if the data is complex, as they can improve performance by minimizing the amount of processing needed for each query execution.\n10. Monitor SQL statements and their execution plans to identify bottlenecks and inefficient queries that might need optimization."}

In this case, it filters on two conditions: the department_id from table a must match with the department_id from table b, and the country_code from table b must be equal to the country_code in table c.\n4.

Use specific exception types instead of generic exceptions (e.g., SqlException) to identify the source and nature of errors accurately.\n3. If an error occurs, provide meaningful error messages to developers for easy debugging and error resolution.\n4. Implement reconnection logic when dealing with temporary connection issues, such as timeouts or lost connections. Attempt a reconnect within a reasonable timeframe before giving up.\n5. Use transactions in combination with try-catch blocks to ensure data consistency when working with multiple operations on the database. Begin and commit transactions only if all operations are successful; otherwise, rollback the transaction.\n6. Centralize exception handling for common errors that can occur across different parts of your application (e.g., a custom ExceptionHandler class). This allows you to maintain error-handling logic in one place while keeping your codebase clean and organized.\n7. Implement retries with exponential backoff when dealing with transient errors, such as timeouts or temporary network issues. After a set number of attempts, consider logging the errors for further review and investigation."}

Provide an example that includes table relationships, navigation properties, and LINQ queries.\nUPDATE customers SET customers.credit_limit = (\n    SELECT AVG(credit_limit) AS avg_credit_limit\n    FROM customers c1\n    JOIN orders o ON c1.customer_id = o.customer_id\n    WHERE o.order_date > '2021-01-01' AND o.payment_status = 'Paid')\nWHERE customers.country IN ('France', 'Germany');", "assistant": "To convert the given Actian 4GL update statement to C#, we can define relationships between tables and use proper navigation properties as well as LINQ queries. Below is an example of how you can achieve this:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Linq;\nusing System.Data.SqlClient;\n\npublic class DatabaseContext : DbContext\n{\n    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }\n    public DbSet<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n\n    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)\n    {\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>()\n            .HasKey(c => c.customer_id);\n\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Order>()\n            .HasKey(o => o.order_id);\n\n        modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>()\n            .HasMany(c => c.Orders)\n            .WithRequired(o => o.Customer);\n    }\n}\n\npublic class Customer\n{\n    public int customer_id { get; set; }\n    public string country { get; set; }\n    public decimal credit_limit { get; set; }\n    // Navigation property to Orders\n    public virtual ICollection<Order> Orders { get; set; }\n}\n\npublic class Order\n{\n    public int order_id { get; set; }\n    public DateTime order_date { get; set; }\n    public string payment_status { get; set; }\n    // Navigation properties to Customer and the primary key relation with Order\n    public virtual Customer Customer { get; set; }\n    public int CustomerId { get; set; }\n}\n```\nWith the defined model, we can write LINQ queries to calculate the average credit limit for customers based on specific conditions:\n```csharp\nusing (var context = new DatabaseContext())\n{\n    var avgCreditLimit = context.Customers\n        .Where(c => c.Orders\n            .Any(o => o.order_date > DateTime.Parse(\"2021-01-01\") && o.payment_status == \"Paid\"))\n        .Average(c => c.credit_limit);\n}\n```\nNow that we have the average credit limit, let's update the credit limit for customers in France and Germany:\n```csharp\nusing (var context = new DatabaseContext())\n{\n    foreach (var customer in context.Customers.Where(c => c.country == \"France\" || c.country == \"Germany\"))\n        customer.credit_limit = avgCreditLimit;\n    context.SaveChanges();\n}\n```\nIn this example, we defined the relationships between `Customer` and `Order` entities using LINQ to SQL's fluent API. The equivalent LINQ query calculates the average credit limit for customers with orders that match certain conditions such as order date and payment status, and then updates their credit limits accordingly."}
