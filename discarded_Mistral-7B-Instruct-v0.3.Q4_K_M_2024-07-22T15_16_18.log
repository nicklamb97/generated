Error handling is essential for maintaining the integrity of data and improving program reliability.\n'

The procedure checks if the input number is either 0 or -1 and sets the result to 1 in these cases, as those numbers have factorials equal to 1 by definition. In all other cases, it multiplies the factorial of `num - 1` with `num` and stores the result. The example initializes a variable `n` as 5 and calls the function `factorial()` to find its factorial, storing the result in `fact`.\n'

This involves defining a global error-handling routine that can be called by various procedures to handle any errors that might occur during execution. Here\'s an example of how to define such a routine:\n\n```\ndefine procedure open_road_error(exception_code = integer, message = character varying);\nbegin\n    write "Error code:", exception_code;\n    write "Error message:", message;\nend;\n```\n\nTo call this error-handling routine in your procedures:\n\n```\ndeclare exception_code : integer;\ndeclare message : character varying(255);\nbegin\n    // Your procedure logic here...\n    if (some condition fails) then begin\n        exception_code = 1001; // Define a specific error code.\n        message = "An error occurred while processing this operation."; // Assign an appropriate error message.\n        call open_road_error(exception_code, message); // Call the error-handling routine.\n        exit; // Exit the procedure to prevent further execution.\n    endif;\nend;\n```\nBy using this approach, you can manage errors efficiently and maintain control over your application\'s flow.\n\n'
