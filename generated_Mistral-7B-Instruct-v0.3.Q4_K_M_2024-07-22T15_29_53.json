Procedure Complexity: The more complex the procedure, the longer it takes to execute. Keep your procedures focused on a single task or logic grouping.\n\n2. Reusability: If you can reuse a procedure across multiple points in your application, this reduces code duplication and improves performance. However, if the code is too specific and only used once, consider inlining it instead to avoid the overhead of procedure calls.\n\n3. Efficiency: Procedures can increase memory usage due to their persistent nature. Optimize memory consumption by minimizing local variable usage and clearing temporary data when not needed.\n\n4. Modularity: Well-organized procedures lead to modular code, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the application over time. This also helps with performance since developers can focus on individual parts of the system without affecting others.\n\n5. Caching: For frequently used procedures, consider implementing a caching strategy to reduce procedure call overhead. However, be mindful of the tradeoff between cache size and memory usage.",
