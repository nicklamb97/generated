{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the purpose of the GhostExec_object in the openframe statement?", "assistant": "The GhostExec_object is a reference variable of type GhostExec that stores the GhostExec object of the opened frame. It can be used to communicate with the opened frame."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can you pass parameters to an opened frame?", "assistant": "You can pass parameters to an opened frame like this:\n```\nopenframe customer_details(customer_id = 1234, show_orders = true);\n```"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between using an actual frame name and a variable in the openframe statement?", "assistant": "Using an actual frame name resolves the reference at compile time, while using a variable resolves it at runtime. This affects timing of name resolution, especially in included applications."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you set the ParentFrame attribute when opening a frame?", "assistant": "You can set the ParentFrame attribute using the withclause:\n```\nopenframe customer_details() with ParentFrame = parent_frame_ref;\n```"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What happens if you assign null to the ParentFrame attribute?", "assistant": "If you assign null to the ParentFrame attribute, the called frame runs as a detached frame, independent of other frames in the application."}

{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you check if a frame reference is not null before sending a user event?", "assistant": "Check if a frame reference is not null before sending a user event like this:\n```\nif frame_ref is not null then\n    frame_ref.SendUserEvent(eventname 'message');\nendif;\n```"}

A called frame can open another frame, creating a nested structure."}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you open a frame and store its reference for later use?", "assistant": "Open a frame and store its reference like this:\n```\nframe_ref = openframe customer_details();\n```"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between openframe and callframe statements?", "assistant": "openframe runs a new frame concurrently with the calling ProcExec, while callframe runs a frame sequentially, waiting for it to complete before continuing."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can you use a variable to specify the frame name in an openframe statement?", "assistant": "Use a variable to specify the frame name like this:\n```\ndeclare frame_name = varchar(30);\nframe_name = 'customer_details';\nopenframe $frame_name();\n```"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What happens if you don't set the ParentFrame attribute in the openframe statement?", "assistant": "If you don't set the ParentFrame attribute, the called frame becomes a child of the calling ProcExec by default."}
