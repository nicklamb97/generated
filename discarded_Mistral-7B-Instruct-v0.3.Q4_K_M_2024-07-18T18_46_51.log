How can we use the `connect` statement with the role identifiers created?\n\n<|assistant|>\nAfter creating roles, they should be associated with sessions via the `connect` statement. For example:\n```sql\nconnect 'username/role_id' @database 'hostname';\n```\nIn this command, the username specifies the operating system account name of the user initiating the session. The role\\_id parameter refers to the role identifier associated with the session.\n\n"

To regain access, the user must enter the correct password or request that their password be changed.\n\n'

This is because the database needs to validate that no other users are currently using the role or its privileges before creating a new one or modifying an existing one.\n\n'

It must be a valid object name that is unique among all role, group, and user identifier names in the installation. If an invalid role identifier is specified, the DBMS Server returns an error but processes all valid role identifiers. `with_option` allows setting password options like `nopassword`, `password = 'role_password'`, or `external_password`.\n\n"
