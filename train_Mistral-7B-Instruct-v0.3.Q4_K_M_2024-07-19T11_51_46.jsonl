Use the For Statement with the counter variable as the index variable, setting the start expression to the initial value of the counter variable and the end expression to the last position of the array (arr.Lastrow).\n4. In the do section of the For Statement, write the code that performs the specific action on the current element of the array using the counter variable as the index.\n5.

This makes them ideal for tasks like performing calculations on large sets of data or looping through records in a database. Here's an example:\n```\nfor i = 1 to array.Lastrow do\n     arr[i].PaymentReceived = TRUE;\nendfor;\n```\nIn this case, the For loop is used to set `PaymentReceived` to true for each element of the array in a single statement, saving both time and development effort compared to manually setting each value individually.\nAnother advantage of using For loops is that they provide better control over iterations. You can specify exact ranges and conditions that determine when to start and end an iteration. This makes them more flexible for handling complex tasks requiring specific rules or logic. Here's an example:\n```\nfor i = 10 to 20 step 2 do\n     if i % 3 = 0 then\n          // Your code here when i is a multiple of 3\n     endif;\nendfor;\n```\nIn this case, the For loop iterates from 10 to 20, incrementing by 2 and only executing the inner code when `i` is a multiple of 3. This allows for precise control over iteration and improves performance in some cases compared to other programming structures like while loops or do-while loops."}
