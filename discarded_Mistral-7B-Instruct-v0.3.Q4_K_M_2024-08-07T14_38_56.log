They facilitate interactions between user interfaces (UI) and data sources by allowing developers to define and manage various aspects of a frame's behavior, such as its appearance, content, and interaction with other parts of the system.\n\n** Input\n<noinput>\n\n"

If this variable is set to true, we will offer a discount. Otherwise, the price remains the same.\n** Output\nTo perform some actions only if certain conditions are met, you can use "if" statements:\n```\nif (is_customer_a_member) then begin -- Check if the customer is a member\n    -- Offer a discount here\nend else begin -- If not a member, keep original price\n    -- No action needed\nend;\n```\n'

We want to get all order details of customer having customer_id 1234.\n\n** Output\nTo perform an SQL SELECT query using Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statements and assign the result to an opened frame variable, use this syntax:\n```\nDECLARE orders_frame as frame;\nopen cursor c for select * from Orders where customer_id = 1234;\nwhile not eof(c) do\n    insert into orders_frame new row (:order_id, :order_date, :customer_id, :product_id);\n    next c;\nend while;\nclose cursor c;\n```\n'
2024-08-07T15:03:23 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat is a cursor and how can we create one in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statements?\n** Output\nA cursor is a database object that represents a server-side memory area, which holds the result of a query or a SELECT statement. It provides access to rows from a result set one row at a time. In Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statements, you can create a cursor using the `define cursor` statement:\n```\ndefine cursor my_cursor for select * from orders;\n```\nThis creates a cursor named `my_cursor`, which points to the result set of the query "select * from orders". You can then use this cursor in a loop to process each row individually.\n'

We want to find their sum and store it in another variable `c`.\n** Output\nYou can use the "Assign" statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Openframe Statements to assign values or results of expressions to variables. To assign the result of a mathematical operation, you can use an "assign" statement as follows:\n```\nassign c = a + b;\n```\n'
