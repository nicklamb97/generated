For example, if the return value is of type float but the expression requires a numeric type, then it should be cast as `numeric_type(float_value)`."}

The parentheses signal that a call to a procedure is being made, and they ensure proper parsing of the expression by the 4GL interpreter. In the following example, the parentheses are empty because no parameters are being passed to the `dbms_error_message` procedure:\n```sql\nmessage 'Cannot insert graphic into the database. ' +dbms_error_message();\n```"}

In OpenROAD, 4GL procedures can return a value of any type, but the data type of the return value must be compatible with the requirements of the expression. For example, if a procedure returns an integer and you use it as part of a text expression, it will generate an error because text and integer are not compatible types for the operation."}
