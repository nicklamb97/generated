It\'s automatically called when you create an instance of that class. A constructor may take parameters, allowing the user to customize the object at instantiation. Here is an example:\n```csharp\npublic class Car\n{\n    public string Color { get; set; }\n    public int NumberOfDoors { get; set; }\n\n    // Constructor takes a single parameter for color\n    public Car(string color)\n    {\n        this.Color = color;\n    }\n}\n\n// Using the class constructor to create an instance\nCar myCar = new Car("Red");\n```\nIn this example, we have defined a `Car` class with two properties: `Color` and `NumberOfDoors`. The class has a single-parameter constructor that takes a string parameter for the color of the car. When you create an instance of the class (`myCar`), it automatically calls the constructor and initializes the object with the specified color.\n\n'
