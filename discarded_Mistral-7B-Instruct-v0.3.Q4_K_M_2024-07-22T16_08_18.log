The primary difference lies in how the SQL code is defined before executing it:\n1. Static SQL defines the SQL statement at compile time. It is more efficient but less flexible since changes require modifying the source code and recompiling the program.\n2. Dynamic SQL builds and executes an SQL statement at runtime by concatenating variable strings. This makes dynamic SQL more adaptable, enabling the creation of complex queries based on user input or programmatic logic; however, it may lead to potential security risks if not handled carefully (e.g., by properly validating and escaping user input).\n- Task 4\n** Instruction\nProvide an example of how to pass parameters to a database procedure using OpenROAD Actian 4GL.\n** Input\ncreate procedure my_procedure(in param1 as char, in param2 as integer);\n** Output\nTo pass parameters to a database procedure using OpenROAD Actian 4GL, you need to define the procedure with input parameters like your example 'my_procedure'. Once defined, call the procedure and pass the values as arguments:\n1. Call the procedure 'my_procedure' in the code: call my_procedure(parameter1_value, parameter2_value);\n2. Replace 'parameter1_value' with the desired character value, and replace 'parameter2_value' with the desired integer value for each specific usage.\n- Task 5\n** Instruction\nExplain how to modify an existing database procedure in OpenROAD Actian 4GL.\n** Input\ncreate procedure my_procedure(in param1 as char); select * from my_table order by my_column;\n** Output\nTo modify an existing database procedure in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, you can use the 'alter' statement along with the 'procedure' keyword. Here is a simple example of modifying the given 'my_procedure':\n1. First, identify the current procedure definition in your code or Object Explorer window and replace it with the desired changes:\n   ```\n   alter procedure my_procedure(in param1 as char, in param2 as integer);\n   select * from my_table order by my_column; -- The modified part\n   ```\n2. Replace the old procedure definition with the new one and save the modification. You can then test the modified procedure to ensure that it functions correctly."

To pass input parameters when calling a procedure, use the colon (:) notation followed by the parameter name within parentheses after the procedure name, like this: `callproc procedure_name(:param1 = :value1, :param2 = :value2)`.\n'

It has a fixed set of parameters that are known at compile time. On the other hand, a dynamic procedure does not need to be precompiled, making it more flexible as it can handle variables or a dynamic number of parameters. The main difference lies in their behavior at runtime: static procedures are optimized for performance due to precompilation, while dynamic procedures offer greater flexibility at the cost of some runtime overhead.\n\n'

Always close cursor resources when they're no longer needed to avoid leaking memory and slowing down the application performance.\n2. Use FOR UPDATE clauses for cursors accessing tables that may be updated by other processes to ensure data consistency.\n3. Minimize the use of dynamic SQL statements within the cursor loop to reduce the complexity of your code.\n4. Limit the number of rows fetched from a cursor at once, as large results can consume considerable memory and lead to poor performance.\n5. Implement proper error handling for cursors by testing for errors with 'sqlca' or creating exception handlers.\n6. Use nested cursors with caution as they can cause issues related to efficiency and readability of your code.\n"

However, there are some differences between them:\n- Database Functions: They perform calculations or operations on one or more input values and return a result. They can be called in SQL statements just like built-in functions (e.g., SUM()).\n- Stored Procedures: They contain a sequence of SQL statements that are executed when the procedure is called. They can accept parameters, perform multiple actions, and can include conditional logic or loops.\n'
