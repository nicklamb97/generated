It does not return a value and is executed without any arguments or values passed back to the calling procedure. On the other hand, a function returns a single value when it finishes executing. It may take input parameters as well.\n\nIn this example, `sales_total` is a function because it calculates the total sales by summing up the `amount` column in cursor `cursor1`, and it returns that value to the calling procedure."}

Then, when closing the source frame and opening the destination frame, you can call a procedure that takes the array as an argument, like `pass_array` in this example. The called procedure should handle the received data accordingly."}
