It allows called frames to call procedures declared locally in their calling frame and lets field scripts declare local procedures callable from anywhere in the frame.\n"}

It cannot be invoked inside an expression. Additionally, if a procedure handle represents a local procedure defined in a frame or global procedure, the Call method cannot be invoked after the frame or global procedure has terminated or from a different thread.\n"}
