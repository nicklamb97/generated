If it returns more than one row, the `select` statement can contain a select loop to process the rows. A `select` statement executed with the `execute immediate` statement cannot be a repeated select.\n\nUse the `into` clause when the value of `statement_string` is a `select` statement. When the `select` statement executes, the values it retrieves are placed in the variables named in the `into` clause. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement. For more information, see Select Statement.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n### statement_string\nSpecifies a string literal, a `varchar` expression, or a reference variable of class `StringObject`. The statement string cannot contain more than one statement. The `varchar` expression should be declared `not null`, or there will be compiler warnings.\n\nIt also cannot contain a Dynamic SQL statement or any of the following SQL statements:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `execute immediate`\n- `fetch`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `set_ingres`\n- `whenever`\n\nBecause the `Value` attribute of the `StringObject` will be passed to the command, it will be limited to 2000 characters. For more information, see the `StringObject` class `Value` Attribute.\n\n### variable\nSpecifies the variable that holds the value of the `select` statement. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement.\n\n### beginendblock\nSee BeginEndBlock.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement executes a dynamically built statement string. This statement does not name or encode the statement and cannot supply parameters.\n\nThe `execute immediate` can be used:\n- If a dynamic statement needs to be executed just once in your program\n- In `drop` statements, where the name of the object to be dropped is not known at the time the program is compiled\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement must be terminated according to the rules of the host language. If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement. The `into` clause specifies variables to store the values returned by a `select`. Use this option when the program knows the data types and lengths of the result columns before the `select` executes. The data type of the variables must be compatible with the associated result columns.\n\n### Permissions\nAll Users\n\nThis statement is available to all users.\n\n### Locking\nThe locking behavior of the `execute immediate` statement depends on which statement is executed.\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate a table defined at runtime by the user:\n```sql\n/* User input assigned to variable new_table */\nnew_table = 'Create table expired_accts(acctno = integer, name = varchar(50) not null)';\n...\nexecute immediate new_table;\n```\n\nExecute a statement in a string object:\n```sql\n/* Declare the string object variable */\nstmt_string = StringObject;\n\n/* Prompt user for input */\nstatus = CurFrame.ReplyPopup\n          (messagetext = 'Enter an SQL statement',\n                    reply = stmt_string):\n/* Execute the statement */\nexecute immediate stmt_string;\n```\n\nExecute a select statement:\n```sql\n/* Declarations */\nemp_no = integer not null;\nemp_name = varchar(256) not null;\nselstring = varchar(256) not null;\n/* Executing code */\nselstring = 'select e_no, e_name from emp_table';\nexecute immediate selstring into emp_no, emp_name\nbegin\n     processing statements\nend\n```"

If it returns more than one row, the `select` statement can contain a select loop to process the rows. A `select` statement executed with the `execute immediate` statement cannot be a repeated select.\n\nUse the `into` clause when the value of `statement_string` is a `select` statement. When the `select` statement executes, the values it retrieves are placed in the variables named in the `into` clause. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement. For more information, see Select Statement.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n### statement_string\nSpecifies a string literal, a `varchar` expression, or a reference variable of class `StringObject`. The statement string cannot contain more than one statement. The `varchar` expression should be declared `not null`, or there will be compiler warnings.\n\nIt also cannot contain a Dynamic SQL statement or any of the following SQL statements:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `execute immediate`\n- `fetch`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `set_ingres`\n- `whenever`\n\nBecause the `Value` attribute of the `StringObject` will be passed to the command, it will be limited to 2000 characters. For more information, see the `StringObject` class `Value` Attribute.\n\n### variable\nSpecifies the variable that holds the value of the `select` statement. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement.\n\n### beginendblock\nSee BeginEndBlock.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement executes a dynamically built statement string. This statement does not name or encode the statement and cannot supply parameters.\n\nThe `execute immediate` can be used:\n- If a dynamic statement needs to be executed just once in your program\n- In `drop` statements, where the name of the object to be dropped is not known at the time the program is compiled\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement must be terminated according to the rules of the host language. If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement. The `into` clause specifies variables to store the values returned by a `select`. Use this option when the program knows the data types and lengths of the result columns before the `select` executes. The data type of the variables must be compatible with the associated result columns.\n\n### Permissions\nAll Users\n\nThis statement is available to all users.\n\n### Locking\nThe locking behavior of the `execute immediate` statement depends on which statement is executed.\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate a table defined at runtime by the user:\n```sql\n/* User input assigned to variable new_table */\nnew_table = 'Create table expired_accts(acctno = integer, name = varchar(50) not null)';\n...\nexecute immediate new_table;\n```\n\nExecute a statement in a string object:\n```sql\n/* Declare the string object variable */\nstmt_string = StringObject;\n\n/* Prompt user for input */\nstatus = CurFrame.ReplyPopup\n          (messagetext = 'Enter an SQL statement',\n                    reply = stmt_string):\n/* Execute the statement */\nexecute immediate stmt_string;\n```\n\nExecute a select statement:\n```sql\n/* Declarations */\nemp_no = integer not null;\nemp_name = varchar(256) not null;\nselstring = varchar(256) not null;\n/* Executing code */\nselstring = 'select e_no, e_name from emp_table';\nexecute immediate selstring into emp_no, emp_name\nbegin\n     processing statements\nend\n```"

If it returns more than one row, the `select` statement can contain a select loop to process the rows. A `select` statement executed with the `execute immediate` statement cannot be a repeated select.\n\nUse the `into` clause when the value of `statement_string` is a `select` statement. When the `select` statement executes, the values it retrieves are placed in the variables named in the `into` clause. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement. For more information, see Select Statement.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n### statement_string\nSpecifies a string literal, a `varchar` expression, or a reference variable of class `StringObject`. The statement string cannot contain more than one statement. The `varchar` expression should be declared `not null`, or there will be compiler warnings.\n\nIt also cannot contain a Dynamic SQL statement or any of the following SQL statements:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `execute immediate`\n- `fetch`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `set_ingres`\n- `whenever`\n\nBecause the `Value` attribute of the `StringObject` will be passed to the command, it will be limited to 2000 characters. For more information, see the `StringObject` class `Value` Attribute.\n\n### variable\nSpecifies the variable that holds the value of the `select` statement. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement.\n\n### beginendblock\nSee BeginEndBlock.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement executes a dynamically built statement string. This statement does not name or encode the statement and cannot supply parameters.\n\nThe `execute immediate` can be used:\n- If a dynamic statement needs to be executed just once in your program\n- In `drop` statements, where the name of the object to be dropped is not known at the time the program is compiled\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement must be terminated according to the rules of the host language. If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement. The `into` clause specifies variables to store the values returned by a `select`. Use this option when the program knows the data types and lengths of the result columns before the `select` executes. The data type of the variables must be compatible with the associated result columns.\n\n### Permissions\nAll Users\n\nThis statement is available to all users.\n\n### Locking\nThe locking behavior of the `execute immediate` statement depends on which statement is executed.\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate a table defined at runtime by the user:\n```sql\n/* User input assigned to variable new_table */\nnew_table = 'Create table expired_accts(acctno = integer, name = varchar(50) not null)';\n...\nexecute immediate new_table;\n```\n\nExecute a statement in a string object:\n```sql\n/* Declare the string object variable */\nstmt_string = StringObject;\n\n/* Prompt user for input */\nstatus = CurFrame.ReplyPopup\n          (messagetext = 'Enter an SQL statement',\n                    reply = stmt_string):\n/* Execute the statement */\nexecute immediate stmt_string;\n```\n\nExecute a select statement:\n```sql\n/* Declarations */\nemp_no = integer not null;\nemp_name = varchar(256) not null;\nselstring = varchar(256) not null;\n/* Executing code */\nselstring = 'select e_no, e_name from emp_table';\nexecute immediate selstring into emp_no, emp_name\nbegin\n     processing statements\nend\n```"

If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement.

This statement does not name or encode the statement and cannot supply parameters.\n\nThe `execute immediate` can be used:\n- If a dynamic statement needs to be executed just once in your program\n- In `drop` statements, where the name of the object to be dropped is not known at the time the program is compiled\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement must be terminated according to the rules of the host language. If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement. The `into` clause specifies variables to store the values returned by a `select`. Use this option when the program knows the data types and lengths of the result columns before the `select` executes. The data type of the variables must be compatible with the associated result columns.\n\n### Permissions\nAll Users\n\nThis statement is available to all users.\n\n### Locking\nThe locking behavior of the `execute immediate` statement depends on which statement is executed.\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate a table defined at runtime by the user:\n```sql\n/* User input assigned to variable new_table */\nnew_table = 'Create table expired_accts(acctno = integer, name = varchar(50) not null)';\n...\nexecute immediate new_table;\n```\n\nExecute a statement in a string object:\n```sql\n/* Declare the string object variable */\nstmt_string = StringObject;\n\n/* Prompt user for input */\nstatus = CurFrame.ReplyPopup\n          (messagetext = 'Enter an SQL statement',\n                    reply = stmt_string):\n/* Execute the statement */\nexecute immediate stmt_string;\n```\n\nExecute a select statement:\n```sql\n/* Declarations */\nemp_no = integer not null;\nemp_name = varchar(256) not null;\nselstring = varchar(256) not null;\n/* Executing code */\nselstring = 'select e_no, e_name from emp_table';\nexecute immediate selstring into emp_no, emp_name\nbegin\n     processing statements\nend\n```"

            "# Execute Immediate Statement\n\nThis statement executes an SQL statement.\n\n## Syntax\n\n```\nexecute immediate statement_string\n          [into variable{, variable}\n          [beginendblock]];\n```\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement performs any of the following functions:\n- Executes SQL statements that you cannot include directly in your 4GL script\n- Executes SQL statements constructed at runtime\n- Includes new SQL functionality in your 4GL scripts\n\nIf you do not include a statement string, a runtime error occurs when the `execute immediate` statement is executed.\n\nA `select` statement as the value of `statement_string` can return one or more rows. If it returns more than one row, the `select` statement can contain a select loop to process the rows. A `select` statement executed with the `execute immediate` statement cannot be a repeated select.\n\nUse the `into` clause when the value of `statement_string` is a `select` statement. When the `select` statement executes, the values it retrieves are placed in the variables named in the `into` clause. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement. For more information, see Select Statement.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n### statement_string\nSpecifies a string literal, a `varchar` expression, or a reference variable of class `StringObject`. The statement string cannot contain more than one statement. The `varchar` expression should be declared `not null`, or there will be compiler warnings.\n\nIt also cannot contain a Dynamic SQL statement or any of the following SQL statements:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `execute immediate`\n- `fetch`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `set_ingres`\n- `whenever`\n\nBecause the `Value` attribute of the `StringObject` will be passed to the command, it will be limited to 2000 characters. For more information, see the `StringObject` class `Value` Attribute.\n\n### variable\nSpecifies the variable that holds the value of the `select` statement. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement.\n\n### beginendblock\nSee BeginEndBlock.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement executes a dynamically built statement string. This statement does not name or encode the statement and cannot supply parameters.\n\nThe `execute immediate` can be used:\n- If a dynamic statement needs to be executed just once in your program\n- In `drop` statements, where the name of the object to be dropped is not known at the time the program is compiled\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement must be terminated according to the rules of the host language. If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement. The `into` clause specifies variables to store the values returned by a `select`. Use this option when the program knows the data types and lengths of the result columns before the `select` executes. The data type of the variables must be compatible with the associated result columns.\n\n### Permissions\nAll Users\n\nThis statement is available to all users.\n\n### Locking\nThe locking behavior of the `execute immediate` statement depends on which statement is executed.\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate a table defined at runtime by the user:\n```sql\n/* User input assigned to variable new_table */\nnew_table = 'Create table expired_accts(acctno = integer, name = varchar(50) not null)';\n...\nexecute immediate new_table;\n```\n\nExecute a statement in a string object:\n```sql\n/* Declare the string object variable */\nstmt_string = StringObject;\n\n/* Prompt user for input */\nstatus = CurFrame.ReplyPopup\n          (messagetext = 'Enter an SQL statement',\n                    reply = stmt_string):\n/* Execute the statement */\nexecute immediate stmt_string;\n```\n\nExecute a select statement:\n```sql\n/* Declarations */\nemp_no = integer not null;\nemp_name = varchar(256) not null;\nselstring = varchar(256) not null;\n/* Executing code */\nselstring = 'select e_no, e_name from emp_table';\nexecute immediate selstring into emp_no, emp_name\nbegin\n     processing statements\nend\n```"

If the statement string is blank or empty, the DBMS Server returns a runtime syntax error.\n\nThe following SQL statements cannot be executed using `execute immediate`:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `enddata`\n- `fetch`\n- `get data`\n- `get dbevent`\n- `help`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `put data`\n- `set_sql`\n- `whenever`\n- Other dynamic SQL statements\n\nThe statement string must not include references to variable names. If your statement string includes embedded quotes, it is easiest to specify the string in a 4GL language variable. If a string that includes quotes as a string constant is to be specified, remember that quoted characters within the statement string must follow the 4GL SQL string delimiting rules.\n\nThe `into` clause can only be used when the statement string is a `select` statement. The `into` clause specifies variables to store the values returned by a `select`. Use this option when the program knows the data types and lengths of the result columns before the `select` executes. The data type of the variables must be compatible with the associated result columns.\n\n### Permissions\nAll Users\n\nThis statement is available to all users.\n\n### Locking\nThe locking behavior of the `execute immediate` statement depends on which statement is executed.\n\n## Examples\n\nCreate a table defined at runtime by the user:\n```sql\n/* User input assigned to variable new_table */\nnew_table = 'Create table expired_accts(acctno = integer, name = varchar(50) not null)';\n...\nexecute immediate new_table;\n```\n\nExecute a statement in a string object:\n```sql\n/* Declare the string object variable */\nstmt_string = StringObject;\n\n/* Prompt user for input */\nstatus = CurFrame.ReplyPopup\n          (messagetext = 'Enter an SQL statement',\n                    reply = stmt_string):\n/* Execute the statement */\nexecute immediate stmt_string;\n```\n\nExecute a select statement:\n```sql\n/* Declarations */\nemp_no = integer not null;\nemp_name = varchar(256) not null;\nselstring = varchar(256) not null;\n/* Executing code */\nselstring = 'select e_no, e_name from emp_table';\nexecute immediate selstring into emp_no, emp_name\nbegin\n     processing statements\nend\n```"

            "# Execute Immediate Statement\n\nThis statement executes an SQL statement.\n\n## Syntax\n\n```\nexecute immediate statement_string\n          [into variable{, variable}\n          [beginendblock]];\n```\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement performs any of the following functions:\n- Executes SQL statements that you cannot include directly in your 4GL script\n- Executes SQL statements constructed at runtime\n- Includes new SQL functionality in your 4GL scripts\n\nIf you do not include a statement string, a runtime error occurs when the `execute immediate` statement is executed.\n\nA `select` statement as the value of `statement_string` can return one or more rows. If it returns more than one row, the `select` statement can contain a select loop to process the rows. A `select` statement executed with the `execute immediate` statement cannot be a repeated select.\n\nUse the `into` clause when the value of `statement_string` is a `select` statement. When the `select` statement executes, the values it retrieves are placed in the variables named in the `into` clause. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement. For more information, see Select Statement.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n### statement_string\nSpecifies a string literal, a `varchar` expression, or a reference variable of class `StringObject`. The statement string cannot contain more than one statement. The `varchar` expression should be declared `not null`, or there will be compiler warnings.\n\nIt also cannot contain a Dynamic SQL statement or any of the following SQL statements:\n- `call`\n- `close`\n- `connect`\n- `declare`\n- `disconnect`\n- `execute immediate`\n- `fetch`\n- `include`\n- `inquire_sql`\n- `open`\n- `prepare to commit`\n- `set_ingres`\n- `whenever`\n\nBecause the `Value` attribute of the `StringObject` will be passed to the command, it will be limited to 2000 characters. For more information, see the `StringObject` class `Value` Attribute.\n\n### variable\nSpecifies the variable that holds the value of the `select` statement. The number and data types of these variables must match the number and data types of the values returned by the `select` statement.\n\n### beginendblock\nSee BeginEndBlock.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `execute immediate` statement executes a dynamically built statement string.
