2024-08-07T14:46:26 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are the steps to call an external program with Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\n** Input\nI have an external C++ application that calculates the average of a set of numbers. I want to call it from my Actian 4GL program so that it performs the calculations for me. Here\'s the C++ code:\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\ndouble calc_avg(int num[], int len) {\n double sum = 0;\n for (int i=0; i<len; ++i) {\n sum += num[i];\n }\n return sum / len;\n}\n```\n** Output\nTo call the C++ application from your Actian 4GL program, you\'ll need to use the EXECUTE STMT command. Here\'s an example of how to do that:\n```sql\nDEFINE VAR char external_app AS "/path/to/your/cpp_program";\nDEFINE VAR int array[] = (1, 2, 3, 4);\nEXECUTE STMT(\'\'\'\n#include <iostream>\nusing namespace std;\ndouble calc_avg(int num[], int len) {\n double sum = 0;\n for (int i=0; i<len; ++i) {\n sum += num[i];\n }\n return sum / len;\n}\nmain() {\n double avg = calc_avg(array, length(array));\n cout << "The average of the numbers is: " << avg << endl;\n}\'\'\', external_app);\n```'

Using a loop (`for each row`) to iterate over data from a specific table or query (`select * from sales where category = category`).\n4. Performing calculations and updating variable values as needed (`category_total += sales; category_count++;`).\n5.
