These values \nare rounded to their amounts in dollars and cents or other currency units on input and output, and arithmetic \noperations on the money data type retain two-decimal-place precision.\n\nMoney variables can accommodate the following range of values:\n$-999,999,999,999.99 to $999,999,999,999.99\n\nA money value can be specified as either:\n- A character string literal\u2014The format for character string input of a money value is $sdddddddddddd.dd. The dollar \nsign is optional and the algebraic sign(s) defaults to + if not specified. There is no need to specify a cents value \nof zero (.00).\n- A number\u2014Any valid integer or floating point number is acceptable. The number is converted to the money data type \nautomatically.\n\nOn output, money values display as strings of 20 characters with a default precision of two decimal places. The \ndisplay format is:\n$[-]dddddddddddd.dd\n\nwhere:\n$ is the default currency symbol\nd is a digit from 0 to 9\n\nThe following environment settings affect the display of money data. For details, see the Workbench User Guide:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| II_MONEY_FORMAT | Specifies the character displayed as the currency symbol. The default currency sign is the dollar sign ($). II_MONEY_FORMAT also specifies whether the symbol appears before of after the amount. |\n| II_MONEY_PREC | Specifies the number of digits displayed after the decimal point; valid settings are 0, 1, and 2. |\n| II_DECIMAL | Specifies the character displayed as the decimal point; the default decimal point character is a period (.). II_DECIMAL also affects FLOAT, FLOAT4, and the DECIMAL data types. |\n\nNote: If II_DECIMAL is set to comma, be sure that when SQL statements within OpenROAD require a comma (such as a list \nof table columns or SQL functions with several parameters), that the comma is followed by a space. For other \nstatements used in OpenROAD, use II_4GL_DECIMAL. For more information, see the Workbench User Guide. For example:\n\n```sql\nselect col1, ifnull(col2, 0), left(col4, 22) from t1;\n```\n\n## Numeric String Data Type\n\nThe numeric string data type is a virtual type that exists only when numeric data types are compared directly with \ncharacter data. If a comparison is requested between these two classes of data, the character data is examined to see \nif it is numeric in form. If it is, then the comparison is performed as though both were numeric. If the data is not \nnumeric, the result will be such that all numbers collate before all non-numbers. For example:\n\n\u2013100 < '-9' < '0.01' < 1 < '1.1e1' < 'one' < 'three' < 'two'\n\nThe numeric conversion is performed using float8 precision and leading and trailing spaces are ignored.\n\nThe data types considered as numeric are all the integer types, all the float types, and decimal. Money is not \ntreated in this manner because it has its own character data compatibility.\n\nTo be deemed numeric, a character data value must contain only one number, which can be in integer, decimal, float, \nor scientific notation form. All the character data types are checked for numeric content except the long variants, \nwhich are treated as non-numeric.\n\n## Logical Key Data Type\n\nThe logical key data type allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a \ntable. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the \ntable do not comprise a unique key.\n\nThere are two types of logical keys:\n1. SYSTEM_MAINTAINED\n2. NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED\n\nSpecify the scope of uniqueness for system maintained logical key columns using the following options:\n- TABLE_KEY: Values are unique within the table.\n- OBJECT_KEY: Values are unique within the database.\n\nTABLE_KEY values are returned to embedded SQL programs as 8-byte strings, and OBJECT_KEY values as 16-byte strings. \nValues can be assigned to logical keys that are NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED using string literals. For example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO keytable(table_key_column) VALUES('12345678');\n```\n\nValues assigned to TABLE_KEYs must be 8-byte strings; values assigned to OBJECT_KEYs must be 16-byte strings.\n\nIn a UTF-8 environment, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE.\n\n### Restrictions on Logical Keys\n\nWhen working with logical keys, be aware of the following restrictions:\n- A system_maintained logical key column cannot be created using the CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT statement. A not \nsystem_maintained data type is assigned to the resulting column.\n- The COPY statement cannot be used to load values from a file into a system_maintained column."

Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the table do not comprise a unique key. There are two types of logical keys: SYSTEM_MAINTAINED and NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED.\n\nSYSTEM_MAINTAINED logical keys are managed by the DBMS Server automatically. They are useful when you want the server to generate unique values for each row. On the other hand, NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED logical keys allow you to assign a unique key value manually to the rows in your table.\n\nTo create a table with these keys, you can specify their type while defining the column data type using SQL statements like CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE. For example:\n\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE mytable (\n    id SYSTEM_MAINTAINED LOGICAL KEY OBJECT_KEY,\n    name CHAR(50) NOT NULL,\n    value INTEGER DEFAULT 0\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, a new table named 'mytable' is created with three columns: id, name, and value. The id column is specified as SYSTEM_MAINTAINED LOGICAL KEY OBJECT_KEY which means the unique key values will be generated by the server across the database. You can also create NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED logical keys using string literals as shown below:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO mytable (name, value) VALUES ('John', 1), ('Alice', 2), ('Bob', 'ABCDEFGHIJKLM');\n```\n\nIn this case, the id column is not explicitly created with a logical key type, but you can manually assign unique string literals to it as shown above.",

The number is converted to the money data type \nautomatically.\n\nOn output, money values display as strings of 20 characters with a default precision of two decimal places. The \ndisplay format is:\n$[-]dddddddddddd.dd\n\nwhere:\n$ is the default currency symbol\nd is a digit from 0 to 9\n\nThe following environment settings affect the display of money data. For details, see the Workbench User Guide:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| II_MONEY_FORMAT | Specifies the character displayed as the currency symbol. The default currency sign is the dollar sign ($). II_MONEY_FORMAT also specifies whether the symbol appears before of after the amount. |\n| II_MONEY_PREC | Specifies the number of digits displayed after the decimal point; valid settings are 0, 1, and 2. |\n| II_DECIMAL | Specifies the character displayed as the decimal point; the default decimal point character is a period (.).

For example:\n\n```sql\nselect col1, ifnull(col2, 0), left(col4, 22) from t1;\n```\n\n## Numeric String Data Type\n\nThe numeric string data type is a virtual type that exists only when numeric data types are compared directly with \ncharacter data. If a comparison is requested between these two classes of data, the character data is examined to see \nif it is numeric in form. If it is, then the comparison is performed as though both were numeric. If the data is not \nnumeric, the result will be such that all numbers collate before all non-numbers. For example:\n\n\u2013100 < '-9' < '0.01' < 1 < '1.1e1' < 'one' < 'three' < 'two'\n\nThe numeric conversion is performed using float8 precision and leading and trailing spaces are ignored.\n\nThe data types considered as numeric are all the integer types, all the float types, and decimal. Money is not \ntreated in this manner because it has its own character data compatibility.\n\nTo be deemed numeric, a character data value must contain only one number, which can be in integer, decimal, float, \nor scientific notation form. All the character data types are checked for numeric content except the long variants, \nwhich are treated as non-numeric.\n\n## Logical Key Data Type\n\nThe logical key data type allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a \ntable. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the \ntable do not comprise a unique key.\n\nThere are two types of logical keys:\n1.

For example:\n\n```sql\nselect col1, ifnull(col2, 0), left(col4, 22) from t1;\n```\n\n## Numeric String Data Type\n\nThe numeric string data type is a virtual type that exists only when numeric data types are compared directly with \ncharacter data. If a comparison is requested between these two classes of data, the character data is examined to see \nif it is numeric in form. If it is, then the comparison is performed as though both were numeric. If the data is not \nnumeric, the result will be such that all numbers collate before all non-numbers. For example:\n\n\u2013100 < '-9' < '0.01' < 1 < '1.1e1' < 'one' < 'three' < 'two'\n\nThe numeric conversion is performed using float8 precision and leading and trailing spaces are ignored.\n\nThe data types considered as numeric are all the integer types, all the float types, and decimal. Money is not \ntreated in this manner because it has its own character data compatibility.\n\nTo be deemed numeric, a character data value must contain only one number, which can be in integer, decimal, float, \nor scientific notation form. All the character data types are checked for numeric content except the long variants, \nwhich are treated as non-numeric.\n\n## Logical Key Data Type\n\nThe logical key data type allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a \ntable. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the \ntable do not comprise a unique key.\n\nThere are two types of logical keys:\n1. SYSTEM_MAINTAINED\n2. NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED\n\nSpecify the scope of uniqueness for system maintained logical key columns using the following options:\n- TABLE_KEY: Values are unique within the table.\n- OBJECT_KEY: Values are unique within the database.\n\nTABLE_KEY values are returned to embedded SQL programs as 8-byte strings, and OBJECT_KEY values as 16-byte strings. \nValues can be assigned to logical keys that are NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED using string literals. For example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO keytable(table_key_column) VALUES('12345678');\n```\n\nValues assigned to TABLE_KEYs must be 8-byte strings; values assigned to OBJECT_KEYs must be 16-byte strings.\n\nIn a UTF-8 environment, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE.\n\n### Restrictions on Logical Keys\n\nWhen working with logical keys, be aware of the following restrictions:\n- A system_maintained logical key column cannot be created using the CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT statement. A not \nsystem_maintained data type is assigned to the resulting column.\n- The COPY statement cannot be used to load values from a file into a system_maintained column."

These values \nare rounded to their amounts in dollars and cents or other currency units on input and output, and arithmetic \noperations on the money data type retain two-decimal-place precision.\n\nMoney variables can accommodate the following range of values:\n$-999,999,999,999.99 to $999,999,999,999.99\n\nA money value can be specified as either:\n- A character string literal\u2014The format for character string input of a money value is $sdddddddddddd.dd. The dollar \nsign is optional and the algebraic sign(s) defaults to + if not specified. There is no need to specify a cents value \nof zero (.00).\n- A number\u2014Any valid integer or floating point number is acceptable. The number is converted to the money data type \nautomatically.\n\nOn output, money values display as strings of 20 characters with a default precision of two decimal places. The \ndisplay format is:\n$[-]dddddddddddd.dd\n\nwhere:\n$ is the default currency symbol\nd is a digit from 0 to 9\n\nThe following environment settings affect the display of money data. For details, see the Workbench User Guide:\n\n| Variable | Description |\n|----------|-------------|\n| II_MONEY_FORMAT | Specifies the character displayed as the currency symbol. The default currency sign is the dollar sign ($). II_MONEY_FORMAT also specifies whether the symbol appears before of after the amount. |\n| II_MONEY_PREC | Specifies the number of digits displayed after the decimal point; valid settings are 0, 1, and 2. |\n| II_DECIMAL | Specifies the character displayed as the decimal point; the default decimal point character is a period (.). II_DECIMAL also affects FLOAT, FLOAT4, and the DECIMAL data types. |\n\nNote: If II_DECIMAL is set to comma, be sure that when SQL statements within OpenROAD require a comma (such as a list \nof table columns or SQL functions with several parameters), that the comma is followed by a space. For other \nstatements used in OpenROAD, use II_4GL_DECIMAL. For more information, see the Workbench User Guide. For example:\n\n```sql\nselect col1, ifnull(col2, 0), left(col4, 22) from t1;\n```\n\n## Numeric String Data Type\n\nThe numeric string data type is a virtual type that exists only when numeric data types are compared directly with \ncharacter data. If a comparison is requested between these two classes of data, the character data is examined to see \nif it is numeric in form. If it is, then the comparison is performed as though both were numeric. If the data is not \nnumeric, the result will be such that all numbers collate before all non-numbers. For example:\n\n\u2013100 < '-9' < '0.01' < 1 < '1.1e1' < 'one' < 'three' < 'two'\n\nThe numeric conversion is performed using float8 precision and leading and trailing spaces are ignored.\n\nThe data types considered as numeric are all the integer types, all the float types, and decimal. Money is not \ntreated in this manner because it has its own character data compatibility.\n\nTo be deemed numeric, a character data value must contain only one number, which can be in integer, decimal, float, \nor scientific notation form. All the character data types are checked for numeric content except the long variants, \nwhich are treated as non-numeric.\n\n## Logical Key Data Type\n\nThe logical key data type allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a \ntable. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the \ntable do not comprise a unique key.\n\nThere are two types of logical keys:\n1.

For example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO keytable(table_key_column) VALUES('12345678');\n```\n\nValues assigned to TABLE_KEYs must be 8-byte strings; values assigned to OBJECT_KEYs must be 16-byte strings.\n\nIn a UTF-8 environment, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE.\n\n### Restrictions on Logical Keys\n\nWhen working with logical keys, be aware of the following restrictions:\n- A system_maintained logical key column cannot be created using the CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT statement.

For other \nstatements used in OpenROAD, use II_4GL_DECIMAL. For more information, see the Workbench User Guide. For example:\n\n```sql\nselect col1, ifnull(col2, 0), left(col4, 22) from t1;\n```\n\n## Numeric String Data Type\n\nThe numeric string data type is a virtual type that exists only when numeric data types are compared directly with \ncharacter data. If a comparison is requested between these two classes of data, the character data is examined to see \nif it is numeric in form. If it is, then the comparison is performed as though both were numeric. If the data is not \nnumeric, the result will be such that all numbers collate before all non-numbers. For example:\n\n\u2013100 < '-9' < '0.01' < 1 < '1.1e1' < 'one' < 'three' < 'two'\n\nThe numeric conversion is performed using float8 precision and leading and trailing spaces are ignored.\n\nThe data types considered as numeric are all the integer types, all the float types, and decimal. Money is not \ntreated in this manner because it has its own character data compatibility.\n\nTo be deemed numeric, a character data value must contain only one number, which can be in integer, decimal, float, \nor scientific notation form. All the character data types are checked for numeric content except the long variants, \nwhich are treated as non-numeric.\n\n## Logical Key Data Type\n\nThe logical key data type allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a \ntable. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the \ntable do not comprise a unique key.\n\nThere are two types of logical keys:\n1. SYSTEM_MAINTAINED\n2. NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED\n\nSpecify the scope of uniqueness for system maintained logical key columns using the following options:\n- TABLE_KEY: Values are unique within the table.\n- OBJECT_KEY: Values are unique within the database.\n\nTABLE_KEY values are returned to embedded SQL programs as 8-byte strings, and OBJECT_KEY values as 16-byte strings. \nValues can be assigned to logical keys that are NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED using string literals. For example:\n\n```sql\nINSERT INTO keytable(table_key_column) VALUES('12345678');\n```\n\nValues assigned to TABLE_KEYs must be 8-byte strings; values assigned to OBJECT_KEYs must be 16-byte strings.\n\nIn a UTF-8 environment, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE.\n\n### Restrictions on Logical Keys\n\nWhen working with logical keys, be aware of the following restrictions:\n- A system_maintained logical key column cannot be created using the CREATE TABLE...AS SELECT statement. A not \nsystem_maintained data type is assigned to the resulting column.\n- The COPY statement cannot be used to load values from a file into a system_maintained column."
