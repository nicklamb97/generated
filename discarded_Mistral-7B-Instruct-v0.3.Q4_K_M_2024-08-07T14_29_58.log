In Actian 4GL, you use a specific SQL statement (SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ...) while in C#, you create a SqlCommand object with the desired SQL query and execute it using the ExecuteReader() method on a SqlConnection instance. Additionally, Actian 4GL stores data locally, while C# typically interacts with a remote database server through ADO.NET (the .NET implementation of ODBC).\n\n'

Use ADO.NET libraries or Entity Framework to interact with SQL databases.\n2. Write your code in a C# file that contains the SQL queries and data processing logic.\n3. Define and initialize a SqlConnection object, specifying the connection string to the database.\n4. Create a SqlCommand object using the SQL query from the 4GL Select statement. Add any necessary parameters if required.\n5. Execute the command by calling either ExecuteReader() or ExecuteNonQuery() method depending on whether you want to return data or just change the data in the database.\n6. Read and process the returned data from the SqlDataReader object.\n7. Ensure proper error handling and exception management throughout the process.\n8. Write clean, modular and testable code following OOP principles as much as possible.'
2024-08-07T14:54:23 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\nWhat is a common issue when converting 4GL SELECT statements to C#? And how can we avoid it?\n** Output\nA frequent challenge is dealing with the differences between Actian 4GL and .NET's data types. To overcome this, it is important to properly cast the returned values based on their corresponding .NET data types. For instance, converting an integer in 4GL to a decimal in C# requires explicit casting like this:\n```csharp\nint myInt = 123;\ndecimal myDec = Convert.ToDecimal(myInt);\n```\n\n"

The parameter "@username" is defined as SqlDbType.VarChar, and its value is set to "JohnDoe".\n'
2024-08-07T15:28:32 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat if we want to retrieve multiple rows using a single query instead of using multiple queries for each row? Can you demonstrate how to implement the conversion from Actian 4GL to C# for such cases? For example: SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Customers.last_name FROM Customers WHERE country = \'USA\';\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nTo retrieve multiple rows with a single query in C#, we can modify the code to use `SqlDataReader`. Here\'s an example:\n```csharp\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    string sql = "SELECT Customers.customer_id, Customers.first_name, Customers.last_name FROM Customers WHERE country = @Country";\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection))\n    {\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@Country", "USA");\n        connection.Open();\n        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n        {\n            while (reader.Read())\n            {\n                int customerId = (int)reader["customer_id"];\n                string firstName = reader["first_name"].ToString();\n                string lastName = reader["last_name"].ToString();\n                // Process data for each row\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, the SQL query is modified to return multiple columns (customer\\_id, first\\_name, and last\\_name) with a single query. The `SqlDataReader` class is used to iterate through the results returned from the query. Each row has its corresponding values accessible using indexing.\n'
2024-08-07T15:33:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nProvide an example of a query in Actian 4GL using the JOIN operator and its equivalent C# code using LINQ for joining two tables based on a foreign key relationship between them. Assume that we have two tables named `orders` with columns `order_id`, `customer_id` and `item_price`, and `products` with columns `product_id`, `product_name`. The orders table has a foreign key column called `product_id` referencing the primary key column in the products table.\n** Output\nActian 4GL example:\n```\nSELECT orders.order_id, orders.customer_id, orders.item_price, products.product_name FROM orders INNER JOIN products ON orders.product_id = products.product_id;\n```\nC# LINQ example:\n```csharp\nvar ordersWithProductInfo = from order in orders\n                            join product in products on order.product_id equals product.product_id\n                            select new { OrderId = order.order_id, CustomerId = order.customer_id, ItemPrice = order.item_price, ProductName = product.product_name };\n```\nIn this example, we use the LINQ `join` operator to join the orders and products tables based on their foreign key relationship (`orders.product_id` referencing the primary key of the `products` table). We create an anonymous type with selected columns from both tables using the `new` keyword in C#, which acts as a temporary class for our results.\n'
