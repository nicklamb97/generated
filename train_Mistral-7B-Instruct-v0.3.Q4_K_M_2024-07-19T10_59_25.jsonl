The value must be a string literal, such as a character sequence. In a UTF-8 environment, logical keys must be passed as type BYTE."}

Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the table do not comprise a unique key. There are two types of logical keys: SYSTEM_MAINTAINED and NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED.\n\nSYSTEM_MAINTAINED logical key values are unique within the table or database depending on the scope specified. The scope can be TABLE_KEY, where values are unique within the table, or OBJECT_KEY, where values are unique within the database. VALUES can be assigned to logical keys that are NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED using string literals."}
