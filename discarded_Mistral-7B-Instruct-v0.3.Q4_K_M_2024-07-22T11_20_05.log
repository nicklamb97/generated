Provide a list of at least three key points to keep in mind during the conversion process.\n** Output\n1. Ensure that the SQL syntax for the UPDATE statement is compatible with C# and SQL Server. This includes using parameters to prevent SQL injection attacks, properly escaping strings, and ensuring correct column names are used.\n2. Be aware of potential data type differences between 4GL and C#/SQL Server. For example, 4GL may use native data types not directly supported in C# or SQL Server. In such cases, convert these native data types to their closest equivalent (e.g., DATE to DateTime).\n3. Carefully handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of UPDATE commands, such as when no row is affected due to an invalid ID or non-existent customer/student. Proper exception handling will help improve your code's robustness and error-handling capabilities."

Here are some best practices for efficient updating of large datasets in C# using SQL connections:\n1. Use transactions to ensure data consistency.\n2. Limit the number of records updated per transaction. This can prevent lock contention and improve overall performance.\n3. Implement pagination or chunking by dividing the dataset into smaller parts (e.g., 500-1000 records) and updating each part sequentially.\n4. Use parameterized queries for better execution plan caching and to avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nHere\'s a code snippet demonstrating these best practices:\n```\nint chunkSize = 1000;\nfor (int i = 0; i < customers.Length / chunkSize; i++)\n{\n    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n    {\n        connection.Open();\n        using (SqlTransaction transaction = connection.BeginTransaction())\n        {\n            for (int j = i * chunkSize; j < (i + 1) * chunkSize; j++)\n            {\n                using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(\n                    "UPDATE customers SET phone_number = @PhoneNumber WHERE customer_id = @CustomerId",\n                    connection))\n                {\n                    command.Transaction = transaction;\n                    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@PhoneNumber", customers[j].phone_number);\n                    command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@CustomerId", customers[j].customer_id);\n                    command.ExecuteNonQuery();\n                }\n            }\n            transaction.Commit();\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n'

This statement assumes that there is only one row in the database with the same employee_id. However, in C#, it\'s essential to ensure data integrity by checking if any updates have been made before committing changes to the database. One solution could be using a transaction, as shown below:\n```\nusing (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    var transaction = connection.BeginTransaction();\n\n    try\n    {\n        using (var command = new SqlCommand("UPDATE employees SET salary = @salary WHERE employee_id = @employeeId", connection, transaction))\n        {\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@employeeId", 1001);\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@salary", 50000);\n            int rowsAffected = command.ExecuteNonQuery();\n        }\n        transaction.Commit();\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        transaction.Rollback();\n        throw;\n    }\n}\n```\nAnother challenge might be handling the different syntax and data types between 4GL and C#, but this can often be addressed through careful analysis and conversion of data structures.\n\n'

Include guidelines on transaction isolation levels, optimistic and pessimistic locking, and conflict resolution strategies.\n** Output\nWhen dealing with concurrent UPDATE operations in Actian 4GL and C#, the following best practices should be considered:\n1. **Transaction Isolation Levels**: Choose a suitable isolation level (e.g., READ UNCOMMITTED, READ COMMITTED, REPEATABLE READ, or SERIALIZABLE) to balance concurrency with consistency, depending on the nature of your application and data.\n2. **Optimistic Locking**: Use timestamps, row versions, or version numbers to check for updates by other concurrent transactions before performing your own update. This method assumes that conflicts are rare and can be resolved easily.\n3. **Pessimistic Locking**: Acquire an exclusive lock on the affected rows using a lock statement in Actian 4GL or using the `SqlCommand.ExecuteReader` method with the `CommandBehavior.LockRows` option in C#. This ensures that no other transaction can modify the data while your transaction is active, but can impact concurrency.\n4. **Conflict Resolution Strategies**: Develop a strategy for resolving conflicts when multiple transactions try to update the same data at the same time. Some options include retrying the operation with a backoff approach, manually resolving the conflict, or escalating to a higher level in your application for handling.\n\nExample of optimistic locking in Actian 4GL:\n```4gl\nDEFINE PROCEDURE UPDATE_INVENTORY:\n    LOOP:\n        FETCH INVENTORY-ITEM NO-LOCK INTO CURSOR CURSOR;\n        IF NOT FOUND THEN LEAVE LOOP;\n        IF (CURSOR.updated_at < :updateTime) THEN:\n            UPDATE inventory SET quantity = @quantity WHERE id = CURSOR.id;\n            COMMIT WORK;\n        ELSE:\n            DISPLAY MESSAGE "Concurrent update conflict.";\n            ROLLBACK WORK;\n            LEAVE LOOP;\n        END IF;\n    END-LOOP.\n```\nIn this example, the `updated_at` timestamp column is used to check for updates by other transactions before performing the update operation. If the row has been updated since the last read (i.e., the `updated_at` value is not equal to the stored `updateTime`), a conflict occurs and the transaction is rolled back.\nIn C#, optimistic locking can be implemented using a version column:\n```csharp\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    string updateCommand = "UPDATE inventory SET quantity = @quantity WHERE id = @id AND version_number = @versionNumber";\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(updateCommand, connection))\n    {\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", 1); // Inventory item ID\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@quantity", 50); // New quantity value\n        int versionNumber = LoadVersionNumber(connection, 1); // Load the current version number before updating\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@versionNumber", versionNumber + 1); // Increment the version number after updating\n\n        // Attempt to update the inventory item\n        int rowsAffected = command.ExecuteNonQuery();\n\n        if (rowsAffected <= 0)\n            Console.WriteLine("Concurrent update conflict.");\n        else\n        {\n            SaveNewVersionNumber(connection, 1, versionNumber + 1); // Update the version number in the database after a successful update\n            Console.WriteLine($"{rowsAffected} rows updated.");\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, before attempting to update the inventory item, the current version number is loaded using a custom method like `LoadVersionNumber()`. If the update operation fails, a conflict occurs and an appropriate message is displayed. If successful, the new version number is saved using a custom method like `SaveNewVersionNumber()` to prevent further conflicts in subsequent updates.\n'

Then, update the UPDATE statement to directly use the C# function and its result instead of calling the embedded 4GL function:\n```\nstring connectionString = "YOUR_CONNECTION_STRING";\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    string query = "UPDATE Customers SET Salutation = @salutation, FirstName = @first_name WHERE Id = @customer_id;";\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))\n    {\n        // Assuming you have implemented the GetFirstName function elsewhere\n        string firstName = GetFirstName(1234);\n        command.Parameters.Add("@customer_id", System.Data.SqlDbType.Int);\n        command.Parameters["@customer_id"].Value = 1234;\n        command.Parameters.Add("@salutation", System.Data.SqlDbType.NVarChar);\n        command.Parameters["@salutation"].Value = "Mr.";\n        command.Parameters.Add("@first_name", System.Data.SqlDbType.NVarChar);\n        command.Parameters["@first_name"].Value = firstName;\n        connection.Open();\n        command.ExecuteNonQuery();\n    }\n}\n```\n'
