You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is a procedure in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "A procedure is a named piece of code that performs a single task. Procedures process in sequence and are not associated with a form, making them useful for eliminating duplication among scripts and enhancing code readability.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can procedures be defined in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Procedures can be defined in two ways:\n- Globally: Accessible from any OpenROAD script within the application or from a second application if included.\n- Locally: Accessible only from the script in which they are defined or from descendent fields within the scope of the calling script.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are the types of procedures available in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "OpenROAD supports three types of procedures:\n- 4GL procedures\n- Database procedures\n- 3GL procedures\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the purpose of database procedures in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Database procedures are created and maintained independently of OpenROAD but must be registered with specific applications. They are available outside of OpenROAD applications.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How are 3GL procedures integrated with OpenROAD?", "assistant": "3GL procedures are created and maintained independently of OpenROAD but must be registered with specific applications to be accessible.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can you provide an example of when to use a procedure in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Procedures are used to eliminate duplication among scripts and make code more readable. For example, a common calculation performed in multiple scripts can be placed in a procedure and called whenever needed.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between event-driven code and procedures in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Unlike event-driven code that is triggered by events in frame and field scripts, procedures process in a sequential manner.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can a procedure access 3GL languages from an OpenROAD script?", "assistant": "Yes, procedures provide the means of accessing a 3GL language from an OpenROAD script.\n"}
