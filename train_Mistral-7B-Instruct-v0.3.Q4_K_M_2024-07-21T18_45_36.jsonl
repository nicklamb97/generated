Then it filters the orders based on whether they do not have an associated invoice. This is a more complex operation since C# does not directly support temporary tables like 4GL.\n\nTo achieve similar functionality in C#, you can use LINQ (Language-Integrated Query) with Entity Framework. Here's an example:\n```csharp\nvar ordersWithoutInvoices =\n    from o in dbContext.Orders\n    where !dbContext.Invoices.Any(i => i.OrderId == o.OrderId)\n    select o;\n```\nIn this C# example, we use LINQ to Entity Framework (EF) to query our database and find orders without associated invoices.

Also, assume that you have an invalid data type when reading from a file.", "assistant": "1. Handling non-existing tables during INSERT operation:\n\nIn 4GL, when a table is missing, the execution stops with an error message. In C#, you can handle this by using `TryParse` method on the connection object to check if the database connection is successful and verify if the table exists. If it doesn't exist, create it before attempting to insert data:\n\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    // Check if table exists\n    string sqlCheckTable = \"SELECT * FROM customers\";\n    using (SqlCommand commandCheckTable = new SqlCommand(sqlCheckTable, connection))\n    {\n        using (SqlDataReader reader = commandCheckTable.ExecuteReader())\n        {\n            if (!reader.HasRows)\n            {\n                // Create the table before inserting data\n                string sqlCreateTable = @\"CREATE TABLE customers (customer_name NVARCHAR(50), email NVARCHAR(100));\";\n                using (SqlCommand commandCreateTable = new SqlCommand(sqlCreateTable, connection))\n                {\n                    commandCreateTable.ExecuteNonQuery();\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Error: \" + ex.Message);\n}\n\n2. Handling invalid data type when reading from a file:\n\nIn 4GL, when encountering an invalid data type while reading from a file, the program execution stops with an error message. In C#, you can use `TryParse` method to validate the input data type before using it in your code:\n\n```csharp\nstring inputData; // Read data from file\nint number;\nif (int.TryParse(inputData, out number))\n{\n    // Data is valid and of integer type\n}\nelse\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid data type for the given input.\");\n}\n```"}

For example, `MyClass`, `myMethod()`, `myVariable`, and `MY_CONSTANT`.\n2. Name classes and interfaces in singular form; name methods and properties using active verbs or nouns that describe the action or purpose of the method or property. For example, `OrderService` for a class handling orders, `CreateOrder()` for a method to create new orders, and `OrdersList` for a list containing order objects.\n3. Use prefixes and suffixes to help developers understand the nature or behavior of methods or variables more easily. Common prefixes include: `get_`, `set_`, `is_`, and `can_`. Some common suffixes include: `Async`, `Event`, `Handler`, `EventArgs`, and `Exception`.\n4. Avoid using abbreviations, acronyms, or single-letter variable names unless they are commonly used (e.g., `i` for an iteration variable in a loop) or the context makes it clear what the variable represents.\n5. Choose meaningful and descriptive names that reflect the purpose or function of the item being named. Avoid using vague or misleading names, such as `thing1`, `var1`, or `temp`."}

Classes and objects: The `BankAccount` class defines a blueprint for bank account-related data and behavior. An instance of this class (the `account` object) is created and used in the `Main` method to simulate the bank account functionality.\n2. Encapsulation: Variables `balance` and `password`, along with the private methods `Deposit()`, `Withdraw()`, and `VerifyPassword()`, help encapsulate data and behavior within objects, making them more secure and easier to manage.\n3. Inheritance and Polymorphism: The code does not include inheritance or polymorphism since it's a simple example. However, these concepts are important in object-oriented programming to allow the reuse of existing code by creating new classes that inherit properties and behaviors from other classes or defining new ways to use them through polymorphic methods and interfaces.\n4. Abstraction: The abstracted implementation of bank account functionality allows developers to interact with a simplified interface without knowing the underlying details about how data is stored, calculations are performed, and security checks are enforced. This improves maintainability and reduces complexity when making changes or adding new features in the future."}
