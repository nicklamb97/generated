Syntax errors in the generated C# code (e.g., incorrect parameter types or missing semicolons). To troubleshoot, double-check your generated C# code against examples and correct any syntax errors found.\n2. Timeout errors due to slow queries or large result sets. To resolve timeout issues, optimize your query by breaking it into smaller pieces if necessary, reducing the result set size with appropriate WHERE clauses, or implementing pagination in your application.\n3.

How can I efficiently manage exceptions in both languages to ensure my program is robust?\n** Output\nTo manage errors effectively, follow these best practices:\n- Use try-catch blocks in C# to catch exceptions and handle them appropriately. In Actian 4GL, you can use the ON EXCEPTION clause or an IF block to check for errors and take corrective actions.\n- Ensure that your database connections are closed after using them. This helps prevent resource leaks and reduces the chances of connection-related errors in C#. In Actian 4GL, make sure you\'re properly closing your cursors, SQL statements, and connections.\n- Use parameterized queries to protect against SQL injection attacks, improve performance, and reduce errors due to improper data types or values in C#. In Actian 4GL, always validate user input before using it in a SELECT statement.\n- Write clear error messages that provide useful information about the error and help you quickly identify and resolve issues.\n- Implement logging for errors to track and review errors that occur during program execution. Logging can also aid in debugging, troubleshooting, and performance analysis.\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Data.SqlClient;\n// Assuming \'connectionString\' is the database connection string\ntry\n{\n    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n    {\n        using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE id = @id", connection))\n        {\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@id", inputId); // User input\n            connection.Open();\n            using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n            {\n                if (!reader.Read())\n                    throw new Exception("No data found for the given ID.");\n\n                // Process data\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");\n}\n```\n'

Provide examples.\n** Input\nSELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = \'IT\' OR department_id = \'HR\';\n** Output\nWhen converting an Actian 4GL SELECT statement to C#, some common pitfalls include:\n- Failing to handle multiple conditions with logical operators such as OR and AND properly. In the example provided, using the SQL OR operator can lead to unexpected results when translated to C#\'s LINQ syntax. Instead, use a combination of && (and) and || (or). For instance:\n```csharp\nvar employees = from emp in employees\n                where emp.Department_Id == "IT" || emp.Department_Id == "HR"\n                select emp;\n```\n- Overusing wildcards (%) in the SELECT statement and not providing proper input validation for user-supplied values. In C#, you should use parameterized queries instead of including them directly in the query string to avoid SQL injection attacks and improve performance. Here\'s an example:\n```csharp\nstring department = "IT"; // User input validation here...\nvar employees = from emp in employees\n                where emp.Department_Id == department\n                select emp;\n```\n'

For example:\n```4gl\nSELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= \'2023-06-01\' AND order_time > \'15:00:00\';\n```\nHowever, C# requires a more specific data type and format for working with dates and times. It uses the DateTime structure, which includes both date and time components. When converting an Actian 4GL query to C#, it\'s necessary to pay close attention to the date and time formats and convert them appropriately:\n```csharp\nusing System;\nusing System.Data.SqlClient;\n// Assuming \'connectionString\' is the database connection string\nDateTime start_date = new DateTime(2023, 6, 1);\nDateTime start_time = new DateTime(2023, 6, 1, 15, 0, 0);\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= @start_date AND order_time > @start_time", connection))\n    {\n        SqlParameter parameter1 = new SqlParameter("@start_date", SqlDbType.DateTime);\n        parameter1.Value = start_date; // Set the date value\n        SqlParameter parameter2 = new SqlParameter("@start_time", SqlDbType.DateTime);\n        parameter2.Value = start_time; // Set the time value\n        command.Parameters.Add(parameter1);\n        command.Parameters.Add(parameter2);\n        connection.Open();\n        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n        {\n            // Process data\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n'

However, Actian 4GL uses the `WHEN` clause in SELECT statements for conditional logic. How would you translate a conditional expression using WHEN in a SQL statement?\n** Input\nAssume we have a table named `employees` with columns `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, and `age`. We want to sort employees based on their age, but if an employee is younger than 30 years old, add 'Young' to their name.\n** Output\nTo translate the conditional expression in SQL, you can use CASE statement as follows:\n```sql\nSELECT id, first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name, age,\n    CASE\n        WHEN age < 30 THEN 'Young' ELSE '' END AS age_label\nFROM employees\nORDER BY age;\n```\n"
