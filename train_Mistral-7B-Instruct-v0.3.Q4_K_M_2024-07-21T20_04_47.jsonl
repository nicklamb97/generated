Provide examples and explain their impact on the code.", "assistant": "1. Forgetting to convert date formats: In 4GL, dates may be stored as character strings without a specified format, while C# requires explicit date formats in DateTime objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors when comparing or sorting dates.\n2. Ignoring null values: If the Actian 4GL SELECT statement does not handle null values appropriately, the resulting C# code might also overlook them, causing missing data or runtime errors. To address this issue, use Nullable<T> types in C# and add null-coalescing expressions where necessary.\n3. Overlooking function differences: Functions that work similarly in 4GL may behave differently when converted to C# because of differences in language semantics and built-in libraries. For example, the built-in TRIM function in Actian 4GL is equivalent to the Trim method in C#.\n4. Neglecting data types: Data type conversions between 4GL and C# can be complex, as some 4GL data types do not have direct equivalents in C#. Carefully examine each data type used in your 4GL code and ensure proper conversions in the resulting C# code to avoid errors.\n5. Misusing collections: Actian 4GL collections may need adjustments when converted to C# due to differences in their behavior and available methods. For example, Actian 4GL provides a SEQUENCE data type that can be used as a stack or queue, whereas C# uses the Stack or Queue classes for similar purposes."}
