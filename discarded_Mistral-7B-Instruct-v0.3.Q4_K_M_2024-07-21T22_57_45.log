Different syntax and programming paradigms: The syntax, keywords, and constructs in Actian 4GL may differ significantly from those in C#, which can lead to confusion while converting the code.\n2. Data types compatibility: Converting data types between Actian 4GL and C# might be an issue due to differences in how they handle certain data types or structures.\n3. Functionality equivalence: Some functionalities in Actian 4GL may not have a direct equivalent in C#, necessitating creative solutions or workarounds during the conversion process.'

Replace the `DO` statement with the `for` or `foreach` loops according to the iteration type (i.e., counting or enumeration).\n2.

The main difference between them lies in their programming paradigm: Actian 4GL is procedural, whereas C# uses the object-oriented approach. Key concepts such as objects, classes, interfaces, and inheritance are fundamental to C# but absent in Actian 4GL. In contrast, control structures like IF, ELSE, SWITCH, and WHILE can be found in both languages, providing common ground for conversion.\n'
