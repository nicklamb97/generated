It first retrieves the sum of `total_sales` for a specific customer (ID 123) and assigns it to the variable `CalcTaxFrame.totalSales`. Inside the nested openframe, it defines another variable `tax`, calculates tax by multiplying `CalcTaxFrame.totalSales` with the `tax_rate` of the same customer, and prints the calculated tax amount.\n'

However, the data insertion fails and you encounter the error message: "Duplicate primary key violation". How do you investigate the issue and resolve it?\n** Output\nWhen you face a "Duplicate primary key violation" error, it means that you are trying to insert duplicate data for a column with a unique constraint. To troubleshoot, you can first check if there are any records in the table with the same primary key values before running the insert statement. If there are, identify and correct the cause of the duplication. You can also modify your code to ensure that only unique values are inserted into the table.\n'
