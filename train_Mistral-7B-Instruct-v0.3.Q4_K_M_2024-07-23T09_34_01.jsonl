The function is implemented in Oracle stored procedures but needs to be called by our Actian 4GL application. Our Actian application sends dates as parameters to Oracle.", "assistant": "To call the `get_orders_by_date` function with an input parameter `2023-02-15`, use:\n```4gl\ncall \"Oracle\" using db_connect pass parameters ('2023-02-15')\n                       procedure get_orders_by_date(pDate date);\n```"}
