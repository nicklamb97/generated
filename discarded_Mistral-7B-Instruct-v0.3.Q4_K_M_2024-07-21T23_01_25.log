In C#, you can use the built-in DateTime data type for working with dates and times. The main difference is that in C#, you can work with date-time components separately (year, month, day, hour, minute, second etc.) while Actian 4GL uses a string format. For example:\n\nActian 4GL:\nDECLARE v_date DATE(format 'YYYY-MM-DD');\nSET v_date = '2023-05-24';\n\nC#:\nDateTime dateTimeObj = new DateTime(2023, 05, 24);\nint year = dateTimeObj.Year;\nint month = dateTimeObj.Month;\nint day = dateTimeObj.Day;"

When working with third-party libraries like Newtonsoft.Json or built-in .NET classes, it\'s essential to use the correct namespace to access the required classes and methods.\n\nTo use the Newtonsoft.Json library, first, you should add a reference to the Newtonsoft.Json assembly in your project. You can do this by going to "Project" -> "Add Reference", then search for "Newtonsoft.Json" under Assemblies and check the box next to it before clicking on the OK button.\n\nNow that you have added the required reference, you can use the JsonSerializer class from the Newtonsoft.Json.JsonSerialization namespace to serialize (convert) an object into JSON format:\n\n```csharp\nusing Newtonsoft.Json;\n\n// Sample Person class.\npublic class Person\n{\n    public string Name { get; set; }\n    public int Age { get; set; }\n}\n\n// Usage\nPerson person = new Person { Name = "John Doe", Age = 30 };\nstring jsonString = JsonSerializer.Serialize(person); // This will serialize the person object into a JSON string.\n```\n\n'
