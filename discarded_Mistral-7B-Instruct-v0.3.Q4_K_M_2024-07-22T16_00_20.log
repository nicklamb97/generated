By wrapping your procedure call within a 'try' block, you can catch any exceptions thrown during execution and perform custom error handling. Here is an example:\n```\ntry\n    callproc some_procedure(input_parameters);\ncatch ex;\n    handle_exception(ex);\nend try;\n```\nIn the example above, we call 'some\\_procedure' with input parameters inside a 'try' block.

Here are some best practices that can help improve execution times:\n1. Minimizing data fetches and writes by using temporary tables, view-merging, and denormalization to reduce I/O operations.\n2. Using indexed data types for columns with frequently used data (e.g., numeric or date) to allow fast filtering and sorting.\n3. Minimizing SQL calls and query complexity by implementing stored procedures, using joins instead of subqueries, and reusing existing queries.\n4. Utilizing caching techniques such as cursor caching and result set caching when appropriate.\n5. Carefully designing your code structure for readability and maintainability to reduce errors and make it easier to optimize in the future.\n6.

On the other hand, local variables are declared within a function or procedure and are only accessible within that specific scope. Global variables can cause unexpected behavior if not used carefully because their values may inadvertently get changed by different parts of the code. Local variables can help prevent this by limiting the scope of the variable to a specific function or procedure, thus ensuring predictable behavior and better encapsulation of code.\n'
