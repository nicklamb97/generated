The possible simple data types include: Character (CHAR), Number (NUMERIC, DECIMAL, INTEGER, FLOAT), Date (DATETIME, DATE) and Logical (LOGICAL).\n\nFor example, if you have a variable named "amount" that represents the price of an item, its type can be specified as:\n```\nNUMERIC amount\n```\nThis will declare "amount" as a numeric type variable. Another example is a variable "order_date" that stores the date when an order was placed, it can be defined as:\n```\nDATETIME order_date\n```\n'

What is the difference between "not default" and "with default" clauses in Actian 4GL OpenROAD Type syntax?\n<|assistant|>\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD Type syntax, "not default" implies that a local variable or parameter does not have an initial value.

It is important to note that in OpenROAD, "with null", "not null", "with default", and "not default" have no effect.\n'
