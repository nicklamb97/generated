2024-08-07T15:12:23 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat are the options for defining a loop range in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD, you can define a loop range using:\n1. A numeric value (e.g., `for i = 1 to 5;`)\n2. An index variable assigned to the first and last elements of a collection (e.g., `for i = first(my_collection) to last(my_collection);`)\n3. Using the `count()` function (e.g., `for i = 1 to count(my_array);`)\n4. Using a SQL query as a loop range (e.g., `for select index, value from my_table order by value;`)\n'
2024-08-07T15:18:38 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are some best practices to follow when using the `continue` statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD within a for loop? Provide an example of how it can be used.\n** Input\nHere is a scenario where we only want to process even numbers in an array:\n```\ndeclare variable arr integer[5] = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n\nfor i = 0 to 4 do\n    if(arr[i] modulo 2) is not equal to 0 then\n        continue;\n    endif;\n\n    -- Process the even number\nendfor;\n```\n** Output\nWhen using the `continue` statement, it causes the current iteration of a loop to be skipped. In your example, when encountering an odd number, it skips the rest of the current loop iteration and moves on to the next one. The code snippet provided demonstrates the usage of `continue` for skipping over odd numbers in an array:\n```\ndeclare variable arr integer[5] = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5);\n\nfor i = 0 to 4 do\n    if(arr[i] modulo 2) is not equal to 0 then\n        continue;\n    endif;\n\n    -- Process the even number\nendfor;\n```\n'

For example:\n- Change the loop to iterate through a range (e.g., 1 to 5) by modifying the values:\n```\nfor i = 1 to 10 do // original code\n    message 'Loop iteration number ' + i;\nendfor;\n\n// To modify the range, use:\nfor i = 6 to 11 do // loop iterates from 6 to 11 (inclusive)\n    message 'Loop iteration number ' + i;\nendfor;\n```\n- Change the increment value used for the `by` clause. For example, instead of incrementing by 1:\n```\nfor i = 0 by 2 of employees do // original code, increments by 2 every iteration\n    message 'Loop iteration number ' + i;\nendfor;\n\n// To change the increment value to 3, use:\nfor i = 0 by 3 of employees do\n    message 'Loop iteration number ' + i;\nendfor;\n```\n"

Place it inside the loop body as follows:\n```\nfor i = 0 by 1 to 5 do\n    // Check for some condition (e.g., an empty row) and exit if found\n    if employees[i].Name is null then exit;\n    message 'Employee name in row number ' + i + ' is ' + employees[i].Name;\nendfor;\n```\n"

The initialization, test condition, and post-test statements are placed within the `for` statement header (`for` clause).\n- A `do until` loop continues executing its body as long as the specified condition is true. In a `do until` loop, you place the control condition in the loop's exit point (`until` keyword) rather than the header.\n"
