Any synonyms and comments defined for the specified object are also dropped. If the object is a table, any indexes, views, privileges, and integrities defined on that table are automatically dropped.\n\nIf an object type is not specified, Ingres assumes you are dropping a table, view, or index.\n\nIf the keyword indicating the object type is specified, the DBMS Server checks to make sure that the object named is the specified type. If more than one object is listed, only objects of the specified type are dropped. For example, if `employee` is a base table and `emp_sal` is a view on the base table `salary`, the following statement:\n\n```\ndrop table employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\ndrops only the `employee` base table (because the keyword `table` was specified and `emp_sal` is a view, not a base table).\n\nTo drop a combination of tables, views, and indexes in a single statement, omit the `object_type` keyword. For example:\n\n```\ndrop employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\nIf an object that is used in the definition of a database procedure is dropped, all permits on the procedure are dropped (the procedure is not dropped). The procedure cannot be executed, nor can the execute privilege be granted on the procedure until all the objects required by its definition exist.\n\nAll temporary tables are deleted automatically at the end of the session.\n\n## Permissions\n\nYou must be the owner of a table, view, or index.\n\n## Locking\n\nThe drop statement takes an exclusive lock on the specified table.\n\n## Related Statements\n\n- Create Table Statement\n- Create View Statement\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following are drop statement examples:\n\n1.

These drop statements are described under separate entries in this chapter:\n  - `dbevent` (see Drop Dbevent Statement)\n  - `group` (see Drop Group Statement)\n  - `integrity` (see Drop Integrity Statement)\n  - `link` (applies to Ingres Star only--see the Ingres Star User Guide)\n  - `procedure`\n  - `role` (see Drop Role Statement)\n  - `rule` (see Drop Rule Statement)\n\n- **object_name**: Specifies the name of a table, view, index, or other valid object.\n\n## Description\n\nThe drop statement removes the specified tables, indexes, or views from the database. Any synonyms and comments defined for the specified object are also dropped. If the object is a table, any indexes, views, privileges, and integrities defined on that table are automatically dropped.\n\nIf an object type is not specified, Ingres assumes you are dropping a table, view, or index.\n\nIf the keyword indicating the object type is specified, the DBMS Server checks to make sure that the object named is the specified type. If more than one object is listed, only objects of the specified type are dropped. For example, if `employee` is a base table and `emp_sal` is a view on the base table `salary`, the following statement:\n\n```\ndrop table employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\ndrops only the `employee` base table (because the keyword `table` was specified and `emp_sal` is a view, not a base table).\n\nTo drop a combination of tables, views, and indexes in a single statement, omit the `object_type` keyword. For example:\n\n```\ndrop employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\nIf an object that is used in the definition of a database procedure is dropped, all permits on the procedure are dropped (the procedure is not dropped).

If more than one object is listed, only objects of the specified type are dropped. For example, if `employee` is a base table and `emp_sal` is a view on the base table `salary`, the following statement:\n\n```\ndrop table employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\ndrops only the `employee` base table (because the keyword `table` was specified and `emp_sal` is a view, not a base table).\n\nTo drop a combination of tables, views, and indexes in a single statement, omit the `object_type` keyword. For example:\n\n```\ndrop employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\nIf an object that is used in the definition of a database procedure is dropped, all permits on the procedure are dropped (the procedure is not dropped). The procedure cannot be executed, nor can the execute privilege be granted on the procedure until all the objects required by its definition exist.\n\nAll temporary tables are deleted automatically at the end of the session.\n\n## Permissions\n\nYou must be the owner of a table, view, or index.\n\n## Locking\n\nThe drop statement takes an exclusive lock on the specified table.\n\n## Related Statements\n\n- Create Table Statement\n- Create View Statement\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following are drop statement examples:\n\n1. Drop the `employee` and `dept` tables.\n   ```\n   drop table employee, dept;\n   ```\n\n2. Drop the `salary` table and its index, `salidx`, and the view, `emp_sal`.\n   ```\n   drop salary, salidx,\n   accounting.emp_sal;\n   ```\n\n3.

            "# Drop Statement\n\nThe drop statement destroys one or more tables, indexes, or views.\n\n**Note**: This statement has additional considerations when used in a distributed environment. For more information, see the Ingres Star User Guide.\n\n## Syntax\n\n```\ndrop [object_type] [schema.]object_name {, [schema.]object_name};\n```\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n- **object_type**: Specifies the type of object to drop, which can be one of the following keywords:\n  - `table`\n  - `view`\n  - `index`\n\n  The following object types can also be dropped. These drop statements are described under separate entries in this chapter:\n  - `dbevent` (see Drop Dbevent Statement)\n  - `group` (see Drop Group Statement)\n  - `integrity` (see Drop Integrity Statement)\n  - `link` (applies to Ingres Star only--see the Ingres Star User Guide)\n  - `procedure`\n  - `role` (see Drop Role Statement)\n  - `rule` (see Drop Rule Statement)\n\n- **object_name**: Specifies the name of a table, view, index, or other valid object.\n\n## Description\n\nThe drop statement removes the specified tables, indexes, or views from the database. Any synonyms and comments defined for the specified object are also dropped. If the object is a table, any indexes, views, privileges, and integrities defined on that table are automatically dropped.\n\nIf an object type is not specified, Ingres assumes you are dropping a table, view, or index.\n\nIf the keyword indicating the object type is specified, the DBMS Server checks to make sure that the object named is the specified type. If more than one object is listed, only objects of the specified type are dropped. For example, if `employee` is a base table and `emp_sal` is a view on the base table `salary`, the following statement:\n\n```\ndrop table employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\ndrops only the `employee` base table (because the keyword `table` was specified and `emp_sal` is a view, not a base table).\n\nTo drop a combination of tables, views, and indexes in a single statement, omit the `object_type` keyword. For example:\n\n```\ndrop employee, emp_sal;\n```\n\nIf an object that is used in the definition of a database procedure is dropped, all permits on the procedure are dropped (the procedure is not dropped). The procedure cannot be executed, nor can the execute privilege be granted on the procedure until all the objects required by its definition exist.\n\nAll temporary tables are deleted automatically at the end of the session.\n\n## Permissions\n\nYou must be the owner of a table, view, or index.\n\n## Locking\n\nThe drop statement takes an exclusive lock on the specified table.\n\n## Related Statements\n\n- Create Table Statement\n- Create View Statement\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following are drop statement examples:\n\n1. Drop the `employee` and `dept` tables.\n   ```\n   drop table employee, dept;\n   ```\n\n2. Drop the `salary` table and its index, `salidx`, and the view, `emp_sal`.\n   ```\n   drop salary, salidx,\n   accounting.emp_sal;\n   ```\n\n3. In an OpenROAD program, drop two views.\n   ```\n   drop view tempview1, tempview2;\n   ```"
