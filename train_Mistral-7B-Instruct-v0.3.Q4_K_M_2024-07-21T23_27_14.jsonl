In other words, instead of inserting variable values directly into the SQL query as string literals, you can pass parameters to the query and let the database handle the proper formatting for each parameter value.\n\nBy using parameterized queries, you can avoid the potential risks of SQL injection attacks that occur when an attacker inserts malicious input into your program or application, thereby altering your SQL query and potentially compromising your database or entire system.\n\nIn C#, you can create parameterized queries by using the SqlCommand object's Parameters collection and then binding the appropriate value to each parameter in the query. This allows for a more secure and efficient way of executing dynamic SQL statements with variables while protecting your code from SQL injection vulnerabilities.\n\nHere's an example of how to use parameterized queries in C#:\n\n```csharp\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    connection.Open();\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(\n        \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = @username\",\n        connection))\n    {\n        command.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@username\", userName); // Replace this with the user's actual input\n        using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n        {\n            while (reader.Read())\n            {\n                int id = reader.GetInt32(0);\n                string name = reader.GetString(1);\n                Console.WriteLine($\"{id} {name}\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```"}

Keep the CATCH block as narrow as possible to only handle the specific exceptions you expect.\n\nFor logging:\n1. Use System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine() for logging debug information, such as internal state changes or execution progress during development.\n2. Use System.Console.WriteLine() for user-facing log messages that should be displayed to users under normal circumstances (e.g., informational messages, success/failure statuses).\n3.

In both Actian 4GL and C#, you can define exception handlers to deal with these situations effectively.\n\nIn Actian 4GL, you can use the ON-ERROR GOTO statement to jump to a specific label when an error occurs in your program. However, it's not as powerful or flexible as C# exceptions handling.\n\nWhen converting to C#, you should surround blocks of code that are prone to errors with try-catch blocks. Here's a simple example:\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    // Code that might throw an exception goes here\n}\ncatch (Exception ex)  // You can define different catch blocks for specific exceptions if needed\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Error occurred: \" + ex.Message);\n}\n```\nThe `try` block contains the code that may generate exceptions, while the `catch` block catches any exceptions thrown within the `try` block and provides a way to handle them properly. In this example, if an exception occurs within the `try` block, the control will jump to the `catch` block, where you can log or handle the error appropriately."}

When dealing with database connections or query execution failures, you may have to use explicit error handling blocks like PERFORM EXCEPTION HANDLING...END PERFORM EXCEPTION HANDLING in Actian 4GL.\nIn C#, we can leverage exceptions and try-catch blocks for error handling. You can wrap the code within a `try` block and provide appropriate catch clauses to handle different types of errors (e.g., SQLException) that may occur when executing database operations. For example:\n\n```csharp\npublic static decimal CalculateAvgSalaryByDept(string deptName)\n{\n    try\n    {\n        // Code for calculating average salary...\n    }\n    catch (Exception ex)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine($\"Error calculating average salary by department: {ex}\");\n        return 0m; // You may want to handle errors more gracefully than returning a default value.\n    }\n}\n```"}

On the other hand, C# has similar control flow statements like if-else, switch-case, goto (although not as commonly used due to its potential for creating spaghetti code), do-while, for, and while loops.\n\nThe syntax of both languages can be quite different when working with loops and conditionals, so it's essential to understand their nuances when converting Actian 4GL to C#:\n\n- For loops in Actian 4GL and C# are syntactically similar, but the initialization, condition, and increment expressions can vary. In Actian 4GL, you can use the FOR loop with an explicit counter or a cursor; in C#, for loops primarily work on arrays and collections (with optional initialization, condition, and increment expressions).\n- While loops are also similar between the two languages, but C# has more flexibility when handling the condition part. In Actian 4GL, you might use WHILE loops with a cursor or when processing data row by row.\n- Conditionals in Actian 4GL primarily rely on IF-THEN-ELSE and CASE statements (similar to SQL), while C# uses if-else and switch-case. Both languages follow the same logic, but the syntax varies between them.\n1. In Actian 4GL:\n```actian\nIF conditional_expression THEN\n    // Executed when the condition is true\nELSE IF another_conditional_expression THEN\n    // Executed when the first condition is false and the second condition is true, etc.\nELSE\n    // Executed if no other conditions are met\nEND IF;\n```\n2.
