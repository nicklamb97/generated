This can occur during the creation or update of records in the table that is associated with the unique index.\n- ROW level: If an `insert` statement attempts to insert a record with a key field value that already exists in the table, the uniqueness constraint will be violated and the operation will fail.

For example, consider a scenario where you have a unique index on 'emp_id' in the 'employees' table.

The `compression` option can be beneficial in scenarios where space is limited or there are large tables with high cardinality (i.e., a significant number of unique values) and relatively few duplicate values.\n\nFor instance, if you have an index on a column called 'gender' in a table that primarily consists of male and female values but has a small percentage of other gender identities, enabling compression can help reduce the overall size of the index without significantly impacting query performance. In such cases, enabling the `compression` option during the creation of the index may result in faster query processing times and less disk usage."}

Provide examples for both unique and non-unique indexes.", "assistant": "The `unique` parameter specifies that the indexed columns must contain only unique values in the table. If two or more rows have the same value(s) for a column(s) with a unique index, an error occurs. The `unique` keyword can be used when creating either unique or non-unique indexes. A unique index guarantees that each row has a distinct set of values in the specified columns. A non-unique index does not enforce uniqueness.\n\nFor example:\n\n* To create a unique index on an employee table's email column, you can use the following SQL statement:\n```sql\ncreate unique index email_idx on employee (email);\n```\n\n* To create a non-unique index on an order table's status column, you can use the following SQL statement:\n```sql\ncreate index status_idx on order (status);\n```"}

This means that the index data for a given key will be stored in multiple physical locations, improving performance and reducing the load on any single storage area. For more information about creating locations and extending databases, see the Ingres Database Administrator Guide."}

How can it be changed?", "assistant": "By default, indexes are created with an ISAM storage structure. However, this default can be overridden by specifying the desired storage structure using the `structure` option when issuing the `create index` statement or by using the `-n` flag when opening a session (`connect`) to specify the default storage structure for indexes created during that session."}

If yes, explain the syntax for dropping an index.", "assistant": "Yes, you can drop an existing index on a table in 4GL by using the `drop index` statement. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```sql\nDROP INDEX index_name ON table_name;\n```\n\nReplace `index_name` with the name of the index that you want to drop, and replace `table_name` with the name of the table on which the index was created. The `drop index` statement removes the specified index from the database. If there are any foreign key relationships using the index, you will need to remove those before you can drop the index."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Explain the purpose and effect of the `unique_scope` option when creating a unique index in 4GL SQL statements.", "assistant": "The `unique_scope` option specifies how uniqueness is checked for a unique index created using SQL statements in 4GL. There are two possible values for this option: `ROW` and `STATEMENT`. The purpose of the `unique_scope` option is to determine whether uniqueness is checked for each row that is inserted or updated, or only at the end of a transaction (i.e., during the commit phase). By default, the `unique_scope` option is set to `ROW`. Here's an example to help clarify the effect of this option:\n\n* If you create a unique index on the `employee_id` column and `unique_scope = ROW`, then each employee ID entered into the table must be unique. If you try to insert or update a row with a duplicate employee ID, the operation will fail immediately.\n* If you set `unique_scope = STATEMENT`, then duplicate employee IDs can be inserted or updated as long as no two rows in the same transaction have duplicate values for the indexed column. The uniqueness check only occurs at the end of the transaction, during the commit phase. This means that multiple rows with duplicate employee IDs can be entered into the table within a single transaction without error, but subsequent transactions will fail if they try to insert or update rows with duplicate employee IDs."}
