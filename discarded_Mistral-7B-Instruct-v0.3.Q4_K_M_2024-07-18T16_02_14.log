Here is an example of how to create a procedure called `MyProcedure` with no parameters:\n\n```\nprocedure MyProcedure =\nbegin\n    statement1;\n    statement2;\n    ...\nend\n[;]\n```\n\nYou can also define parameters for your procedure. For instance, here is an example of a procedure named `MyProcedure` with one parameter called `my_parameter`:\n\n```\nprocedure MyProcedure (my_parameter param1) =\nbegin\n    statement1;\n    statement2;\n    ...\nend\n[;]\n```\n\nRemember to replace `param1` with a proper data type for the parameter. For more information about creating 4GL procedures, you can refer to the *Workbench User Guide*.\n'

It is used when you call the procedure in the application. `parameterlist` specifies parameters that are passed to the procedure. The number of parameters is arbitrary and they can be any simple data type acceptable to OpenROAD or any named user class or system class. `statementlist` includes any OpenROAD statement.\n\n'
2024-07-18T16:20:05 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat are the steps to create a global 4GL procedure in Actian?\n** Output\nTo create a global 4GL procedure, use the OpenROAD Workbench to name the procedure and declare its return value. You then write the actual procedure statement in 4GL. Here\'s a simplified step-by-step guide:\n1. Name your procedure\n2. Declare the return value (if any)\n3. Write the procedure statement in 4GL, which declares the parameters and provides the processing statements\n4. For more information, refer to the *Workbench User Guide*.\n5. To learn about the syntax of a global 4GL procedure, you can check out the example given under "Procedure Statement" section of the document provided.\n\n'
2024-07-18T16:20:05 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nCan you explain how local procedures work in Actian?\n** Output\nLocal Procedures are procedures that are declared within another procedure, allowing them to be used only within the containing procedure. They don't exist outside their parent procedure. Local Procedures are useful for organizing code and reducing redundancy. For more information about local procedures, you can refer to the *Language Reference Guide* online help.\n\n"
2024-07-18T16:21:06 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat is the purpose of using parameters in global 4GL procedures?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL, you can use parameters when creating a global procedure as they are passed to the procedure and can also be used as local variables within the procedure. A 4GL procedure can have any number of parameters and they can be simple data types or named user classes or system classes.\n'

They allow for more flexible and dynamic behavior within the procedure, as they can be set with different values each time the procedure is called.\n<|assistant|>\nHow does a procedure return control to the script or procedure that called it?\n<|user|>\nA procedure returns control using the 'return' statement in Actian 4GL SQL. This statement allows for passing a value back to the calling script or procedure, if needed. The returned value must match the specified return data type of the procedure.\n"
