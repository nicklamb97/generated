        "output": "1. The continue statement can be beneficial when you want to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one, without executing the remaining code in that iteration. This is useful if there's a condition that should make the loop iteration invalid or unnecessary. For example, in data processing loops, you might use a continue statement to avoid processing rows with specific row states like RS_DELETED or RS_UNCHANGED.\n2. The continue statement causes the program execution to jump to the beginning of the next iteration of the loop. This skips the remainder of the current loop iteration and moves on to the next one, allowing you to quickly skip over unimportant iterations.\n3. A 'continue statement' can be used within 'for', 'select', or 'while' loops in Actian 4GL OpenROAD.\n4. Here's an example that demonstrates using a continue statement with a loop to process rows efficiently:\n\n```\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= x.LastRow do\n     if x[i]._RowState != RS_CHANGED then\n          i = i + 1;\n          continue;\n     endif;\n     /* Process row */\n     i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n5. The 'label' parameter allows you to specify the loop that you want to continue using when executing a 'continue statement'. If no label is specified, OpenROAD continues with the innermost loop. This can be useful for working with nested loops and maintaining clarity in your code by explicitly identifying which loop should be continued.",

The inner Continue Statements help skip specific cases when either `x._column1` is less than `5`, or `x._column2` exceeds `10`. However, when all three conditions (either `x._column1 >= 5`, `x._column2 <= 10`, and `x._column3 >= 20`) are met for a particular row, the outer Continue Statement helps skip that iteration entirely and continues with the next one.",
