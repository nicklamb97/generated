Forgetting to handle errors as explained in Task 1.\n2. Misusing parameter names and types, leading to unexpected results or run-time errors.\n3. Overlooking data type mismatches between procedure inputs/outputs and variables or expressions they're used with.\n4. Calling recursive procedures improperly, resulting in infinite loops.\n5.

How to declare a cursor and open it for processing?\n** Output\nCursors are used for processing rows one-by-one from a result set returned by a SQL statement in Actian 4GL. To declare a cursor, you use the `define cursor` statement followed by the cursor name and the query that returns the result set. Here's an example:\n```\ndefine cursor my_cursor as select id, name from Customer;\nopen my_cursor;\n```\nThis declares a cursor named `my_cursor` with the SQL statement `select id, name from Customer`. To start processing the rows returned by the query, you then open the cursor using the `open` keyword. You can then use the `fetch next` statement to retrieve and process one row at a time.\n"

When calling the function, enclose the string value in single quotes. To handle different cases, use built-in functions like `UPPER()`, `LOWER()`, and `TRIM()`. Here\'s an example:\n1. Define the procedure header with input parameters:\n```\nPROCEDURE format_string(str AS STRING, caseFormat AS CASE);\n```\n2.

Performance: Procedures can improve performance by encapsulating repetitive or complex operations.
