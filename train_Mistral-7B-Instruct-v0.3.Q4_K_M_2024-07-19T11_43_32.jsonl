If it is, the high_number frame is called. Otherwise, the low_number frame is called. If the value of 'status' is not equal to 'n', then the unknown_status frame is called."}

If the first condition is true, it executes the 'then' statements and skips the 'elseif' block. If the first condition is false, OpenROAD checks the secondary condition and executes its corresponding statements until it finds a true condition or reaches the 'else' block if all conditions are false."}

For each employee, it checks if their number is greater than 5. If true, it adds that employee to a list called `employee_list`."}
