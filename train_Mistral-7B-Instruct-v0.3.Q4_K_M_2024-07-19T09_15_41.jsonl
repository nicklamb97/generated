The framename parameter in the callframe statement is an example of a dynamic name because it can be a variable that resolves to a frame name during program execution. For instance:\n```4gl\nframename = 'my_dynamic_frame';\ncallframe framename;  // This will open the frame 'my_dynamic_frame'\n```\nIn this example, the value of the variable framename determines which frame is opened at runtime."}

Here's an example: If you have a calling frame for creating a new project and need to collect information about the project from the user, you might use a callframe statement to open a dialog box asking for specific details, such as project name and description. Once the user enters their responses, control is returned to the calling frame, and you can continue processing the data."}

A real-world application might involve a parent window (the calling frame) requesting specific information from the user, which is then used to call child windows (nested frames) to display more detailed forms or options related to the original query.\n\nFor example:\n```4gl\nparent_frame:\n    prompt \"Select an option:\" with options('Option A', 'Option B');\n    case when parent_option = 'Option A' then\n        callframe child_frame_A(some_parameter);\n    when parent_option = 'Option B' then\n        callframe child_frame_B(another_parameter);\n```\nIn this example, the `parent_frame` initiates a dialog asking the user to choose between two options. Depending on their selection, it will open either `child_frame_A` or `child_frame_B`, which are nested frames."}

The named parameter list (NPL) syntax can be employed, which allows you to assign dynamic values to the called frames' arguments. This is useful when dealing with multiple values or complex data types that need to be transferred between frames.\n\nHere's an example using a Named Parameter List:\n```4gl\ncallframe my_child_frame(param1 = value1, param2 = value2);\n```\nIn this case, `my_child_frame` is the called frame, and it receives two values, `value1` and `value2`, as parameters when called."}

If you use an actual frame name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the frame reference at runtime. This allows for more dynamic and flexible coding by allowing the name of the called frame to be determined at runtime rather than being hard-coded into the application."}

By nesting called frames inside other frames, they can organize related functionality into separate, reusable components that can be easily managed and maintained. This also makes it possible for the called frame to call another frame, creating a chain of nested frames that can interact with each other as needed."}

This flexibility enables more dynamic application development as you can change the name of called frames without having to modify the code."}
