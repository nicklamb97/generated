When using dynamic name resolution, OpenROAD resolves the reference to the frame or procedure based on the current executing component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script), and if not found, it searches for a global component (a frame or procedure).\n4. ** Instruction**\nProvide an example of how dynamic name resolution can help you call a frame from one application to another in OpenROAD.\n5. ** Input**\n<noinput>\n6. ** Output**\nAn example of using dynamic name resolution for cross-application calls involves defining a variable containing the dynamically specified frame name and using the `callframe` statement to execute the frame in another application. Here is an example:\n\nAssume we have three applications: Application A, Application B, and Application C. Application A includes both Application B and Application C.\n\nIn Application B, there is a frame named 'FrameB'. In Application C, there is a frame named 'FrameC'. We want to call FrameB from Application A using dynamic name resolution.\n\nTo do this:\n1. Define a variable in Application A containing the dynamically specified frame name:\n```scss\ndeclare var nmFrame varchar;\n...\nnmFrame = 'FrameB'; // assuming Application B is included and FrameB exists\n...\n```\n2. Use the `callframe` statement along with the variable that contains the dynamically specified frame name to call FrameB:\n```scss\nbegin\n  callframe :nmFrame;\nend;\n```\nThis will execute FrameB from Application B when it is encountered during runtime in Application A, as long as both conditions are met (Application B is included and FrameB exists)."

What is dynamic name resolution in OpenROAD and when does it occur?\n   * Dynamic name resolution in OpenROAD occurs during the execution of a callframe, openframe, gotoframe, or callproc statement. It means that instead of resolving names at compile time, resolution takes place at runtime.\n3. In what context can you use the dynamic name resolution feature in OpenROAD?\n   * The dynamic name resolution feature can be used when you need to specify a frame or procedure name at runtime rather than during compilation.\n4. What are the limitations of dynamic frame and procedure name resolution in OpenROAD?\n   * With dynamic frame and procedure name resolution, the search order for components cannot be changed unless the component belongs to an application. Also, if you don't qualify the component name with the application's name, OpenROAD follows its usual search order, which may lead to unexpected behavior.\n5. What is the difference between explicit and dynamic name resolution in OpenROAD?\n   * In explicit name resolution, names are resolved at compile time based on their declared location, whereas in dynamic name resolution, names are resolved during runtime when specified by a callframe, openframe, gotoframe, or callproc statement. Dynamic name resolution provides more flexibility, but it may lead to issues if the specified name does not exist."

2024-07-19T13:03:21 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n1. Explain the process of dynamic frame name resolution in OpenROAD and how it differs from regular name resolution?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn OpenROAD, when you specify a frame name at runtime using statements like openframe or callframe, the reference is resolved dynamically rather than during compile time. The process of dynamic frame name resolution involves searching the currently executing component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script) for a local frame with the specified name first. If not found, it then searches for a global frame. Unlike regular name resolution where OpenROAD follows a specific search order, in dynamic name resolution, the default global search starts from the topmost running application.\n2. Give an example illustrating the difference between regular and dynamic name resolution in OpenROAD?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nLet's consider two applications: App A contains a frame named A1, while App B contains a frame named B1. In regular name resolution, if you use 'callframe A1' from App B, it would lead to a runtime error since OpenROAD is looking for a local A1 in the current component of App B (which doesn't exist). However, using dynamic name resolution by specifying 'callframe :nm1' where nm1 contains the value 'A1', the reference is resolved correctly as it searches for the frame A1 in both App A and App B.\n3. How can a dynamically specified procedure or frame name be qualified in OpenROAD to search within a specific application?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn OpenROAD, you can qualify a component name with the application's name using the syntax [Application_Name]!Component_Name. For example, to search for a procedure or frame within Application A, you would use 'callframe A!Procedure_Name'. This tells OpenROAD to search the specified application (in this case, Application A) instead of following its regular search order.\n4. What happens when a dynamically specified procedure name is not found in the currently executing component and the global search starts from a different application than the topmost running application?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen a dynamically specified procedure name is not found in the currently executing component, OpenROAD searches for it globally starting with the topmost running application. However, if the topmost running application isn't the desired search starting point, you can use 'callframe Application_Name!Procedure_Name'. For instance, suppose a procedure named TestProc is in App C (which was not the topmost running application initially), but you want to call it from App A using dynamic name resolution. You would do this by using 'callframe AppC!TestProc' instead of simply 'callframe TestProc'.\n5. Explain why can't we change the search order when a component belongs to a frame, procedure, method, or user class script?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen a component belongs to a frame, procedure, method, or user class script, you cannot change the search order because these components are already bound to their respective contexts. Modifying the search order would lead to unpredictable results as the component may be found unexpectedly. To access such components from different contexts, OpenROAD allows you to qualify the name with the application's name using the syntax [Application_Name]!Component_Name."
2024-07-19T13:14:40 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nExplain when OpenROAD uses dynamic frame and procedure name resolution in comparison to explicit name resolution.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn OpenROAD, dynamic frame and procedure name resolution is used when you specify a frame or procedure name using statements like callframe, openframe, gotoframe, or callproc. This happens at runtime rather than at compile time. When you use these statements, OpenROAD first searches for a local procedure with the dynamically specified name within the current component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script). If it is not found, OpenROAD then searches globally starting from the topmost running application by default.\nIn contrast, explicit name resolution occurs when you explicitly specify the name of a component in your code. This type of resolution happens at compile time and OpenROAD will look up the specified name strictly within the current event block, local procedure, user class method, field script, enclosing field scripts, frame or global procedure, or application. The search order for explicit name resolution is different than dynamic name resolution as it prioritizes the current event block or local procedure before searching globally.\n'
