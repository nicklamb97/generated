Consider the following code example:\n```scss\ndeclare var nm1 varchar;\nbegin\n  nm1 = 'A';\n  callframe :nm1;\nend;\n```\nIn this example, the variable `nm1` is assigned the value 'A'. The `callframe :nm1` statement then resolves to the frame 'A' dynamically at runtime.

The default global search order starts with the topmost running application.\nIf a dynamically specified procedure or frame is found in an included application, it can be called from the including application using dynamic name resolution. For example, if Application A includes Application B and Application B contains a dynamically named frame, Application A can call that frame using the `callframe` statement with the appropriate variable."}

Initially, OpenROAD searches for a local procedure with the dynamically specified name within the currently executing component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script). If it doesn't find one, it then searches for a global component (a frame or procedure) starting from the topmost running application. The default search order is the topmost running application, which is the application with which the user began the session."}

In dynamic name resolution, OpenROAD searches for the component within the currently executing component first before searching globally, whereas in explicit name resolution, the search order remains unchanged."}

When you use a dynamic name, such as callframe or callproc statements to specify a frame or procedure, OpenROAD searches for the specified name within the currently executing component (a frame, global procedure, or user class method script). If it is not found, OpenROAD then searches for a matching global component (a frame or procedure) using the default search order starting from the topmost running application.\nOn the other hand, explicit name resolution refers to when you explicitly specify the name of a component in your code. This type of resolution happens at compile time and OpenROAD will look up the specified name strictly within the current event block, local procedure, user class method, field script, enclosing field scripts, frame or global procedure, or application. The search order for explicit name resolution is different than dynamic name resolution as it prioritizes the current event block or local procedure before searching globally."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What are some considerations when using dynamic name resolution in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "There are several considerations to keep in mind when using dynamic name resolution in OpenROAD:\n1. Dynamic name resolution occurs at runtime, so it may lead to unexpected behavior if the specified component does not exist or is not properly defined at the time of execution.\n2. Dynamic name resolution has a different search order compared to explicit name resolution, starting with the current application and proceeding through included applications and finally reaching the core library. This difference can cause confusion when dealing with multiple applications and their components.\n3. Qualifying the dynamic name with the application's name helps in resolving names from specific applications instead of using the usual search order. The syntax is: \"application_name!component_name\".\n4. Including an incorrectly specified dynamic name can lead to compile warnings or runtime errors depending on whether the component exists within the currently executing component or globally."}
