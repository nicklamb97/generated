To import or export large text data, you can use the following syntax:\n```\nCOPY my_table FROM datafile USING DELIMITER 'nl' FIELDS:\n  clob field1 nl ...;\n```\nIn this example, all rows in the `my_table` table containing a column of type `clob` will be updated with the large text data from the corresponding row in the data file."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Describe the difference between fixed-length and variable-length data types in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements.", "assistant": "Fixed-length data types have a predefined, constant length, regardless of the size of the actual data. For example, the `byte(n)` or `char(n)` format in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements has a specified length n that is used to allocate space for the value in memory and in the file. If the data value is shorter than the allocated length, it will be padded with null characters or spaces to reach the specified length.\nOn the other hand, variable-length data types are not fixed and their lengths may vary. For example, `byte varying(n)` or `varchar(n)` format in Actian 4GL SQL COPY statements allocates space only for the actual data and pads it with null characters if necessary when reading from the file.\nIn general, fixed-length formats are more efficient for large volumes of data with uniform length, while variable-length formats are more suitable for data with varying lengths."}

The `DELIMITER` option specifies the character(s) that separate fields and mark the end of records in the data file. For example, you can use the comma as a delimiter with `DELIMITER ','`. If no delimiter is specified, the first comma, tab, or newline encountered ends the value.\nThe backslash character (`\\`) is used to escape special characters that would otherwise be treated as delimiters or escape sequences. For example, if you want to include a comma in the data and use it as a literal value, you can precede it with `\\`. For instance, if you want to import a string containing commas, you can use:\n```\nCOPY my_table FROM datafile USING DELIMITER ',' FIELDS: varchar(50) field1;\nfield1 value: John\\ Doe, Jane\\ Smith\n```\nIn this example, the commas in `John Doe, Jane Smith` are escaped with `\\`, so that they are not interpreted as delimiters and the entire string is imported as a single value."}

To include a null value during data import or export using the COPY statement, simply use the `NULL` keyword where you would typically place a value. If no delimiter is specified, a single NULL character (0x00) will be used. For example:\n\n```sql\ncopy table employees (name=char(10), age=integer4, salary=float4, department=char(15)) from 'employees.csv' delimiters=comma null='NULL';\n```\nIn this case, the NULL keyword is specified to handle null values during data import or export and replace them with the string `NULL`."}

If set to CONTINUE, copy continues after encountering conversion errors and skips the row that caused the error, displaying a warning for each error. If set to TERMINATE (the default), copy terminates immediately upon encountering a conversion error without skipping any rows."}
