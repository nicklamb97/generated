They allow structured data to be handled and transferred between the two environments.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Where must the EXEC 4GL keywords be placed in an ESQL/C program?", "assistant": "The EXEC 4GL keywords must be placed before each 4GL statement in an Embedded SQL for C (ESQL/C) program. This syntax is similar to that for Embedded SQL and SQL/Forms.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can EXEC 4GL statements be used outside of Embedded SQL programs?", "assistant": "No, EXEC 4GL statements can only be used in Embedded SQL programs that are designed to pass objects and arrays between 3GL and 4GL routines.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How is structured data passed to 3GL in the context of EXEC 4GL statements?", "assistant": "Structured data is passed to 3GL as a handle, which is referenced in the EXEC 4GL statements whenever an object or array needs to be indicated. This handle is always a 4-byte integer.\n"}
