You must use the LocalVariableDeclaration statement for that.\n'

If yes, provide an example with a numeric variable and a string variable.\n<|user|>\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nYes, you can initialize local variables during the declaration process in Actian 4GL. Here is an example using both a numeric (integer) and a string type:\n```\nmy_integer **=** 42;\nmy_string **=** "Hello, World!";\n```\nIn this case, the integer `my_integer` is initialized to the value 42, while the string `my_string` is assigned the text "Hello, World!".\n'

This allows for temporary storage and manipulation of data during the execution of a program.\n\n'

Provide an explanation with an example for each.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nGlobal variables are accessible throughout a program, whereas local variables have scope only within their respective subroutine or function. Here's an example demonstrating both global and local variable declarations:\n```\nglobalVar INTEGER = 0;\n\nPROCEDURE myProc():\n    LOCAL Var INTEGER = 123; // Local variable 'Var' is only available within 'myProc()'\n\n    WRITE myProc, globalVar;\nEND PROCEDURE;\n```\n"

The integer type is implied by the lack of any suffix (e.g., .L or .Z).\n\n"
2024-07-19T13:16:33 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nDescribe the role of LocalVariableDeclaration in Actian 4GL programming?\n** Output\nLocalVariableDeclaration is used to define and create a local variable within the context of an Actian 4GL program. Local variables are stored within the current procedure or function's stack frame, and are accessible only within the scope they are declared. A variable's lifecycle begins with its declaration and ends when the procedure or function completes. During this time, local variables hold data values that can be used to process the information within the program.\n"

For instance, if you want to create a local variable named "myVariable" of type character (char), you would write: `myVariable = char;` This declares the variable with an undefined value of type \'char\' in the scope where the statement is executed.\n'

Provide an example.\n** Output\nTo update or modify the value of a declared local variable in Actian 4GL, simply assign a new value using the equal sign (`=`) operator. For instance:\n```\ncounter = counter + 1;\n```\nThis code will increment the `counter` variable by one each time it is executed.\n'
