Make sure you convert the error handling logic appropriately.\n3. Collections: Actian 4GL has specific collection types (e.g., A-sets) which do not have direct equivalents in C#. Use arrays or List<T> instead for most cases.\n4. Functions and procedures: If your code contains complex functions and procedures, consider refactoring them into simpler methods or classes to make the conversion process easier.\n5. Control structures: Actian 4GL has some unique control structures like the WHILE-DO loop which may not have a direct equivalent in C#. Convert them to C# equivalents such as while loops and for loops.\n6. Variable scoping: Be aware that variable scoping is different between both languages. Ensure you use appropriate access modifiers (e.g., public, private, protected) when converting variables and member fields.\n7. Style differences: While it may not cause functional issues, it's important to update the coding style to be consistent with C# standards.

Additionally, avoid using subqueries, complex expressions, and nested functions in queries whenever feasible.\n\n2. **Batch Processing**: Instead of retrieving all data at once, use paging or batch processing to reduce memory usage and improve performance. Divide your result set into smaller chunks, process one chunk at a time, and then fetch the next chunk only when necessary.\n\n3. **Caching**: To minimize repeated queries that may impact performance, cache frequently accessed data in memory for quick access. Use appropriate caching strategies to efficiently manage cached data, such as eviction policies or expiration times.\n\n4. **DataReader**: Utilize the ADO.NET DataReader object instead of filling a DataSet, since it maintains an open connection to the database and consumes fewer resources.\n\n5. **Asynchronous Operations**: For long-running queries or operations, consider using asynchronous programming techniques such as async/await in C# to improve application responsiveness and avoid blocking the user interface.\n\n6. **Connection Pooling**: Implement connection pooling when working with ADO.NET to reduce overhead caused by creating and closing connections repeatedly.

For example, set up a Service Bus trigger for the \"InventoryLevelCritical\" event that sends an alert to the warehouse team via email.\n4. Configure the order processing event to check for sufficient inventory and send appropriate notifications (e.g., sending emails or push messages) if needed.\n5. Integrate all Azure Function apps into your application by defining their triggers, input bindings, output bindings, and connecting them through an event pipeline (e.g., using Service Bus topics and subscriptions).\n6.

On the other hand, OpenROAD's scalability may be limited compared to Actian DMP.\n3. **Real-Time Analytics**: Actian DMP offers real-time analytics capabilities out of the box, enabling immediate insights from integrated data. In comparison, OpenROAD primarily focuses on data replication and may require additional tools or integrations for advanced analytics features.\n4. **Data Security**: Both platforms prioritize security, but Actian DMP has a more extensive set of built-in security features and supports fine-grained access control policies for data protection.\n5. **Vendor Support**: As an established enterprise solution, Actian offers dedicated support services to help organizations address any issues or questions regarding its platform effectively. OpenROAD may have fewer resources available for ongoing technical assistance compared to Actian DMP.\n\nWhen choosing between Actian DMP and OpenROAD, it is crucial to consider the specific requirements of the integration project in terms of data volumes, real-time needs, scalability, analytics capabilities, security requirements, and support services.

Type inference for each column during runtime, since C# requires knowing the type of each field at compile time. You can use `System.Data.DataReader` to dynamically retrieve data from a DataSet or DataTable without having explicit knowledge about the column types.\n\nA possible solution:\n1. Use Reflection and ExecutionContext.ExecuteSqlCommand in C# to generate dynamic SQL queries based on the columns of the provided table, like in Actian 4GL:\n```csharp\nstring sql = \"SELECT * FROM \" + p_table; // Dynamic SQL generation\nusing (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    using (var command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection))\n    {\n        connection.Open();\n        var result = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);\n        // Use the resulting DataReader to process data dynamically\n    }\n}\n```\n2. Use `System.Data.DataReader` instead of explicitly typed variables when dealing with dynamic data to avoid knowing each column's type at compile time:\n```csharp\nusing (var connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    using (var command = new SqlCommand(sql, connection))\n    {\n        connection.Open();\n        using (var reader = await command.ExecuteReaderAsync().ConfigureAwait(false))\n        {\n            while (await reader.ReadAsync().ConfigureAwait(false))\n            {\n                var data = new List<string>(); // Create a list to store each column's value as a string\n\n                for (int i = 0; i < reader.FieldCount; i++)\n                    data.Add(reader[i].ToString());\n                // Now you can process the dynamic data 'data'...\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```",

Break down the problem into smaller, manageable functions: Start by identifying and breaking down the main tasks in your Actian 4GL code into individual functions that can be easily translated to C#. This approach makes it easier to maintain the logic as you convert each function.\n2. Understand data types: Actian 4GL has its own set of data types, so you'll need to familiarize yourself with their counterparts in C#. For instance, CHARACTER in Actian 4GL is equivalent to string in C#, while NUMERIC is mapped to decimal or double depending on the precision required.\n3. Handle loops and conditions: Actian 4GL uses WHILE and REPEAT loops along with conditional statements such as IF-THEN-ELSE. In C#, these are replaced by the \"for\", \"foreach\", \"while\", and \"if-else\" constructs respectively. Be sure to convert the looping logic accurately while maintaining the desired behavior.\n4. Mimic Actian 4GL control structures: Some Actian 4GL control structures like PERFORM, GO SUBROUTINE, and GO BLOCK do not have direct counterparts in C#. Instead, you can use C# classes and methods to mimic their functionality while maintaining a similar flow.\n5. Test thoroughly: Once your conversion is complete, make sure to thoroughly test the code to ensure it behaves as expected and that there are no errors or inconsistencies. Pay particular attention to complex loops and conditions, which can be more prone to issues during conversion.",
