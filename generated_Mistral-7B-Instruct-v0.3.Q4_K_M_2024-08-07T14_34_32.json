You can do this by checking the status of the SQLCA (SQL Communications Area) structure in your C code after each EXEC 4GL call to ensure that no errors occurred. If an error does occur, you can examine the SQLCA fields to determine the nature and cause of the error so that appropriate action can be taken.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nresult = execsql( myExecSqlStatement ); /* execute a SQL command */\nif ( sqlca->sqlcode != 0 ) { /* check for errors */\n   printf(\"Error code %d occurred.\\n\", sqlca->sqlcode);\n   exit(-1); /* handle the error appropriately */\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `myExecSqlStatement` is the SQL statement being executed and `result` holds the result of the execution. The `sqlca->sqlcode` field contains the status of the execution, with a value of 0 indicating success. If an error occurs, it will have a non-zero value, which can be used to determine the nature of the error and take appropriate action.",
