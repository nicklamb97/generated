You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can the sleep statement be used to pause after user input in Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "Yes, developers can use the sleep statement to introduce pauses before or after user interactions. For example:\n```4gl\nuser_input = 10;\nIF user_input > 10 then\n    MESSAGE \"Input is greater than 10.\";\nELSE\n    MESSAGE \"Input is less than or equal to 10.\";\nENDIF;\nsleep 3;\nMESSAGE \"End of program.\";\n```\nThis waits for 3 seconds before displaying \"End of program.\"\n"}
