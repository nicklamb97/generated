It is often used to display dialogs for user input relevant to\nthe calling frame.\n"}

Variable in the calling frame to receive the return value.\n- `framename`: Name of the frame to be called. It can be a dynamic name.\n- `parameterlist`: Parameters passed to the called frame.\n- `withclause`: Additional options for frame placement and behavior.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does the callframe statement handle frame name resolution?", "assistant": "In Actian 4GL, framename can be an actual name or a variable resolved at runtime. Compile-time resolution\nis used for actual names, while runtime resolution applies to variables, allowing dynamic frame invocation.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can callframe statements be nested?", "assistant": "Yes, callframe statements can be nested, enabling called frames to further call other frames recursively,\nfacilitating complex application flow and interaction.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the role of return statement with callframe?", "assistant": "The return statement exits a called frame and passes a value back to the calling frame using returnvariable,\nensuring compatibility of data types between the frame's return value and the receiving variable.\n"}
