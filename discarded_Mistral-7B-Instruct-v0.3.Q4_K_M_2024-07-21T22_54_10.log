Provide at least three guidelines.\n** Output\n1. Use equivalent constructs: When converting Actian 4GL code, try to use the most appropriate C# construct for the same functionality. For instance, use ADO.NET for database operations and LINQ for querying data.\n2. Manage resources: Just like in C#, make sure you manage resources such as memory, files, and database connections during the conversion process. This helps to avoid memory leaks and other resource-related errors.\n3. Validate input data: Validate user input to ensure it meets certain criteria before performing any operations with it. In C#, you can use regular expressions or custom validation methods for this purpose.\n'

2024-07-22T02:00:58 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nExplain the differences between the Actian Data Language (4GL) and C# in terms of syntax, features, performance, and common use cases. In your answer, discuss how Actian 4GL is optimized for data manipulation tasks while C# is often used for general-purpose applications.\n** Output\nActian Data Language (4GL) is a high-level programming language specifically designed for database management and data processing. It excels in data manipulation tasks, including SQL statements, triggers, stored procedures, and user-defined functions. The syntax of 4GL emphasizes data manipulations with a simple and easy-to-learn syntax optimized for business logic implementation.\n\nOn the other hand, C# is a general-purpose programming language developed by Microsoft as part of .NET Framework. It is widely used for creating Windows desktop applications, web applications (ASP.NET), and games (Unity). While it can be used for data manipulation tasks, its syntax focuses more on object-oriented programming constructs such as classes, objects, interfaces, and exceptions.\n\nIn terms of performance, C# generally offers better performance in computationally-intensive operations due to its managed code environment which utilizes a garbage collector to handle memory management automatically. Actian 4GL, on the other hand, has optimized data manipulation capabilities, particularly for real-time data processing and reporting tasks.\n\nIn summary, Actian 4GL is well-suited for data-intensive applications requiring real-time processing, while C# shines in general-purpose programming for creating a wide range of software applications with the added benefit of being part of a large ecosystem and having access to various libraries and frameworks.\n'

The array can hold values of different types and you can dynamically allocate its size. For example:\n```4gl\nDECLARE ARRAY OF VARIABLE employeeArray;\nASSIGN LENGTH TO employeeArray = 5; // Set the length to 5\nASSIGN employeeArray[1] = 'John';   // Assign values to array elements\n```\n"
