It's useful for situations where you need to repeat a block of code until a certain criterion is met. Here's an example with different conditions:\n\n```4gl\ndefine i integer = 1;\ndefine j integer = 5;\ndefine k integer = 0;\n\nwhile i < 6 do\n    MESSAGE 'i is less than 6';\n    if j == 5 then\n        MESSAGE 'j equals 5';\n        let j = 0;\n    endif;\n    if k > 3 then\n        MESSAGE 'k is greater than 3';\n    endif;\n    let i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, three conditions are checked inside the loop.

In Actian 4GL, you can create an infinite loop using the `while` statement with a condition that will always be true, such as:\n\n```4gl\nwhile true do\n    -- Your code goes here\nendwhile;\n```\n\nTo exit an infinite loop, it is essential to include a mechanism for user input or some other method for terminating the loop. One way to achieve this is by using a function that accepts user input as a parameter and checks if the user has chosen to stop the program. Here's an example:\n\n```4gl\nwhile true do\n    let response character = ask 'Do you want to quit (Y/N)?';\n    if upper(response) eq 'Y' then\n        exit;\n    endif;\nendwhile;\n```\n\nIn this example, the infinite loop continuously asks the user whether they want to quit.

Explain how to use the `endloop` statement in Actian 4GL and provide an example demonstrating its usage in a loop.\n3. Compare the syntax of a for loop and while loop in Actian 4GL, providing examples of both types.\n4. Describe a situation when you would want to use a while loop over a for loop in Actian 4GL, providing an example if possible.\n5. Explain how you can make a while loop run a certain number of times in Actian 4GL without using the \'endloop\' statement.\n\n** Example Task Output **\n1. Here is an example that iterates through the values 5 to 1 and prints them with a message using Actian 4GL syntax:\n```4gl\ndefine i integer = 5;\n\nwhile i > 0 do\n    MESSAGE I;\n    let i = i - 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n2. The endloop statement in Actian 4GL is used for exiting a while loop early, based on some other condition within the loop. Here\'s an example:\n```4gl\ndefine i integer = 0;\n\nwhile true do\n    if (i > 3) or (CURRENT_DATE() >= \'2024-12-31\') then\n        endloop;\n    endif;\n    let i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\n3. The for loop and while loop syntax in Actian 4GL are as follows:\nfor loop syntax:\n```4gl\nfor var = from to step by step do\n    -- statements to execute\nendfor;\n```\nwhile loop syntax (from the document provided):\n```4gl\nwhile condition do\n    -- statements to execute\nendwhile;\n```\n4. You may want to use a while loop when you don\'t know in advance how many iterations you need, or when the iteration count is not a simple arithmetic progression, as is often the case with user input validation. Here\'s an example:\n```4gl\ndefine input integer;\n\nread integer into input;\n\nif (input <= 0) then\n    MESSAGE "Input must be greater than 0."\nelse do while (input > 10) do\n        write "Enter a number between 1 and 10: ";\n        read integer into input;\n    enddo;\nendif;\n```\n5. You can use the following method to make a while loop run a certain number of times in Actian 4GL by defining an initial variable and decrementing it in each iteration until it reaches zero:\n```4gl\ndefine count integer = 10;\n\nwhile count > 0 do\n    -- statements to execute\n    let count = count - 1;\nendwhile;\n```'

Here's a simple example of using both `while` and `endloop` together in Actian 4GL:\n\n```4gl\ndefine i integer = 1;\ndefine max_iter integer = 3;\n\nwhile i <= max_iter do\n    MESSAGE I;\n    if i == 2 then\n        endloop;\n    endif;\n    let i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\nIn this example, the loop will print the numbers from 1 to 3 (excluding 2), because it ends when `i` equals 2.\n\n"
