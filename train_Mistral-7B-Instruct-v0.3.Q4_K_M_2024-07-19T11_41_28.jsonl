Any code between them will be part of the procedure definition.\n\nHere's an example illustrating these components:\n\n    declare\n        beginprocedure my_procedure;\n            -- Procedure implementation goes here.\n        endprocedure my_procedure;\n    enddeclare\n\nIn this example, `my_procedure` is the name of the declared procedure.

These procedures help structure our game logic in a clean and organized manner by keeping variables specific to each procedure within their respective local scopes. When the player interacts with the game (e.g., collecting items or entering the treasure room), the appropriate procedure is called to process the action accordingly."}

Organizing code: Using DeclareBlockWithProcedures helps keep your program organized by encapsulating related variables and procedures within a single scope. This makes it easier for others to understand the code and reduces potential conflicts between variables with the same name.\n2. Isolating variables: By declaring local variables, you can avoid unintentionally affecting global variables or creating issues due to variable naming conflicts. This helps ensure that your program runs correctly and efficiently.\n3. Reusable logic: Local procedures can be used multiple times throughout your program, allowing you to reuse existing code and reduce duplication. This makes it easier to maintain, update, and debug your code over time.\n4. Improving performance: By limiting the scope of variables and local procedures, you minimize the amount of memory that is consumed by your program. This can help improve the overall performance and efficiency of your Actian 4GL application.\n5. Encapsulating complex logic: Local procedures allow you to encapsulate complex logic within a single block, making it easier for others (or future versions of yourself) to understand and modify your code. By breaking down your program into smaller, more manageable parts, you can make it more maintainable over time."}
