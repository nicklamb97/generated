On the other hand, local 4GL procedures can only be called within the script where they are defined or descendent fields (fields within the scope of the calling script).\n\n'

Local 4GL procedures are declared and defined in the frame, field, or procedure script in which they are called, while global 4GL procedures are created in the OpenROAD Workbench and are accessible from any OpenROAD script within an application or, if included, another application as well. The main difference between them is the scope of accessibility; local ones can be called only within the script in which they are defined or by descendent fields (fields within the scope of the calling script), while global ones can be called from any OpenROAD scripts throughout the application(s).\n'

Here's a possible response:\n\n** Output\nGlobal procedures are defined independently of the OpenROAD script they are called from. They can be called from any OpenROAD script within an application or from another application if it includes them. Local procedures, on the other hand, are defined within the scope of a frame, field, or procedure script and can only be called from that script or descendant fields (fields within the scope of the calling script).\n\n"

Can you describe each of them briefly?\n** Output\n- 4GL procedures are created in the OpenROAD Workbench for global use or declared and defined within a frame, field, or procedure script for local use. They provide a way to eliminate code duplication and make scripts more readable.\n- Database procedures are created and maintained independently of OpenROAD but must be registered with specific applications. They can be accessed outside of OpenROAD applications.\n- 3GL procedures are also created and maintained separately from OpenROAD, but they should be registered with specific applications as well. Unlike 4GL and database procedures, they provide access to external programming languages like C or Java from an OpenROAD script.\n'
