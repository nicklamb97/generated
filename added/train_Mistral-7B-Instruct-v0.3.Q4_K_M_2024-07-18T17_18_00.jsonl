On the other hand, global variables are declared outside of any procedure or function block and can be accessed from multiple procedures or blocks throughout your program.\n\nTo access a global variable within a 3GL Procedure, declare it before the begin-of-program (eop) statement, just like you would in 4GL:\n\n```\ndata my_global = 'initial value';\nbegin-of-program;\n...\nmy_c_procedure(); // This is your 3GL Procedure\n...\n\n// Inside the 3GL Procedure\nvoid my_c_procedure()\n{\n    printf(\"Global variable value: %s\\n\", my_global);\n}\n```\n\nRemember to declare global variables using the 'data' keyword, similar to how you would in 4GL. The value of the global variable can be modified from within your C procedure as well."}

Parameters in a stored procedure can be declared as input/output parameters, allowing the stored procedure to modify the input parameters and return modified values upon completion. Regular functions do not have this feature.\n4. Stored procedures often execute with elevated privileges, as they are saved in the database, whereas regular functions run under the security context of the calling program or script.\n5. A stored procedure can be executed using a SQL statement, while a regular function must be called from within another 4GL program or script.\n\nUse stored procedures when you need to encapsulate complex logic that can be reused across multiple programs or scripts.

Add diagnostic statements, such as messages or traces, to the procedure to understand the flow and gather more information about the problem. These statements can help identify the root cause of issues or incorrect results.\n2. Use debugging tools like the \"Debugger\" in Actian SQL Central, which allows you to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and control program execution at specific points. This tool provides a detailed view of the procedure's execution and can help you quickly identify the issue causing incorrect results.\n3. Analyze logs, error messages, and trace files to further understand the problem and its cause. Actian SQL Central provides various logging features that record program execution details, which can be helpful in debugging complex procedures."}
