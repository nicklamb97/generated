Examples include reading and writing data, updating variables, or sending emails. Here's an example of a function that writes data into a file:\n```\nprocedure write_data_to_file(filename, data);\n    open file filename for write;\n    write filename data;\n    close file filename;\nend procedure;\n\nwrite_data_to_file('log.txt', 'Log message');\n```\n"

This provides flexibility as it enables changing the procedure being called without modifying the calling code. Dynamic procedure calls use the execute command and can take parameters if required.\n```\ndeclare var proc_name string = 'MyProc'; -- Assign the name of the procedure to a variable at runtime\nexecute proc_name with parameter1, parameter2; -- Execute the specified procedure with its arguments\n```\nIn this example, the name of the procedure to be executed (MyProc) is assigned to a variable (proc\\_name), and then it is passed as an argument to the execute command. This allows you to change the procedure being called dynamically at runtime by simply modifying the value of proc\\_name.\n"

Here's an example:\n```\nprocedure ShowMessage(message text);\nShowMessage('Hello World!');\n```\nIn this example, `ShowMessage()` is called with a single parameter `message` set to 'Hello World!'.\n\n"
