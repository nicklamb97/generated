They are used to perform operations outside the scope of OpenROAD.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you maintain and compile 3GL procedures for OpenROAD?", "assistant": "3GL procedures are maintained and compiled outside of OpenROAD. After creating and compiling the 3GL source code, you must register the procedure in the application using the OpenROAD Workbench. For more information, refer to the Workbench User Guide.\n"}

It cannot return a pointer to a local character buffer.\n"}
