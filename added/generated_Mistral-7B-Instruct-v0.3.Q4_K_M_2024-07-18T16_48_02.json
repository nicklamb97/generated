This statement allows you to specify actions to be taken if an error occurs while executing your code. Here's an example: ```sql on error goto handle_error; callproc update_product(1001, 'Smartphone X', 599.99); leave handle_error: message box \"An error occurred while updating the product.\";\n``` In this example, we use the 'on error' keyword to define a label (e.g., 'handle_error') and specify the action to be taken in case of an error (e.g., displaying a message box). We then call the database procedure and use the 'leave' statement to exit the 'handle_error' label normally when no errors occur, or jump back to the label if an error does occur.",

        "output": "A common best practice when writing SQL statements in OpenROAD Actian 4GL is to optimize query performance by limiting the number of records returned as much as possible while still meeting the requirements. To find customers whose names contain a specific search term, you can use the `LIKE` operator along with wildcard characters (such as the percent sign '%'). Here's an example SQL statement for searching customers based on the input search term 'Smith': ```sql select * from customers where name LIKE '%Smith%';\n``` To incorporate this SQL statement into your \"search_customers\" stored procedure, you might write code similar to the following: ```sql -- Get user input for search criteria (for example, using a form or web interface)\ndeclare search_term varchar(50);\ninput 'Enter search term: ', :search_term;\n-- Prepare the SQL statement with the search term as a parameter\nprepare stmt1 from 'select * from customers where name LIKE ?';\nexecute stmt1 using :search_term || '%';\n``` In this example, we first take user input for the search criteria and store it in the `search_term` variable. We then prepare an SQL statement that includes the `LIKE` operator with a wildcard character on both sides of the search term (to match partial names) and execute the prepared statement using our `search_term` value.",

        "output": "To handle errors that occur when calling a database procedure in OpenROAD Actian 4GL, you can use try-catch blocks and raise/throw statements.

Please contact administrator for more information.\";\nend catch;\n``` In this example, we define two exceptions, 'no_matching_customer_id' and 'error_during_deletion'. We call the 'delete_customer' procedure with a customer ID as a parameter. If no matching customer is found or an exception occurs during deletion, it raises one of the defined errors (no_matching_customer_id or error_during_deletion). We use the try-catch block to handle these errors and provide appropriate messages based on their types.",

        "output": "To optimize an SQL query for better performance, you can apply various techniques depending on the specific query structure and dataset characteristics. Here are some common tips:\n1. Use indexing on columns used in JOIN conditions, WHERE clauses, GROUP BY statements, and ORDER BY clauses to reduce scan times.\n2. Avoid using subqueries as they can negatively impact performance; consider joining the necessary tables instead.\n3. Simplify your queries by eliminating unnecessary column selections, filters, or calculations that don't contribute to the final result.\n4. Use the EXPLAIN statement to analyze the query execution plan and identify bottlenecks. Based on the analysis results, you can modify your query or database schema accordingly.\n5. For complex queries with large datasets, consider using stored procedures or prepared statements for caching query results and reducing repeated workload.\n\nHere's an example of optimized 'get_top_products' SQL query: ```sql -- Ensure indexes on columns sales_id (primary key), product_id, and total_sales\nalter table sales add index (product_id);\nalter table sales add index (total_sales);\n-- Optimize get_top_products query\nselect p.product_name, sum(s.total_sales) as total_sales\nfrom products p left join sales s on p.product_id = s.product_id\ngroup by p.product_name\norder by total_sales desc limit 10; ``` By using indexing on 'product_id' and 'total_sales', we reduce the scan time for joining tables and sorting records. Simplifying the query by eliminating unnecessary columns (e.g., sales_id) also contributes to faster execution times.",

        "output": "In OpenROAD Actian 4GL, you can handle exceptions when calling database procedures using a combination of error handling constructs such as `ON EXCEPTION` blocks, `RAISE ERROR`, and custom exception handling classes. Here's an example for the \"update_customer\" stored procedure:\n\n1. Define your custom exception class to hold error details: ```sql create class exception_handler as object (\nerror_code integer,\nerror_message text\n);\n```\n2. In your main procedure, use `ON EXCEPTION` blocks to catch errors during execution and raise custom exceptions using the `RAISE ERROR` statement: ```sql -- Start a transaction before making changes\nbegin;\n-- Attempt to update the customer details\nupdate customers set name = :new_name, city = :new_city, phone = :new_phone where id = :customer_id;\n-- If any errors occur during execution, raise a custom exception with error details\non exception\ndeclare error_obj exception_handler;\nset error_obj.error_code = SQLCODE;\nset error_obj.error_message = sys_msg();\nraise error error_obj using 'Update of customer #:customer_id failed with error code: :error_code and message: :error_message';\n-- Rollback the transaction if an error occurred\nrollback;\nend exception;\n``` In this example, we first start a transaction before attempting to update the customer details. If any errors occur during execution (such as invalid input or database errors), they are caught using an `ON EXCEPTION` block and a custom exception object is created with error details. We then raise a custom exception using the `RAISE ERROR` statement, which includes the error details along with a user-friendly message to be returned to the calling application. If no errors occur, the transaction is committed successfully.",

We then use `JOIN` statements to link these tables based on their common columns: customer\\_id in the orders table should match id in the customers table, and order\\_id in the order\\_items table should match id in the orders table. Finally, we apply a `WHERE` clause to filter the results for orders placed by the specific customer (customer ID 100) and use a `GROUP BY` statement to group the results by customer name, product code, quantity, and price. This allows us to retrieve the total order amount for each item within an order and sum the amounts across all orders for the specified customer.",
