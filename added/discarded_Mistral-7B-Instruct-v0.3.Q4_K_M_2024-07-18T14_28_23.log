You must declare a forward reference before you can define a local procedure. Put the forward reference in the declare block for the script in which the local procedure is defined.\n\n'

On the other hand, a global procedure can be called from any script. While defining a global procedure, you must use a different set of keywords (`globalproc`) compared to a local procedure (`localproc`).\n'

The syntax for defining a local procedure is as follows:\n```\nprocedure procname [([parameterlist])] =\n[declare\n    localvariablelist\n[enddeclare]]\nbegin\n    statementlist\nend\n[;]\n```\n\n'
2024-07-18T14:41:56 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat is the purpose of forward references when defining local procedures in Actian 4GL?\n** Output\nThe purpose of forward references when defining local procedures in Actian 4GL is to declare a reference for the local procedure before it can be defined. This allows you to use the procedure later on without encountering errors.\n\n'

It is best practice to match the order for clarity and ease of troubleshooting.\n\n'
2024-07-18T14:43:27 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are the data types expected by a local procedure defined in Actian 4GL SQL?\n<|user|>\nCorrect Answer: The data types of local procedures in Actian 4GL SQL are not explicitly stated in the document, however, it is implied that they can be any valid data type as specified during their definition using the syntax `localvariabletype localvariablename`. For example, `float8 myFloat = 0;` defines a variable `myFloat` of data type `float8`.\n\n'
2024-07-18T14:48:35 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nExplain the role of forward reference in defining local procedures in Actian 4GL SQL.\n** Output\nTo define a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL, you first need to declare a forward reference before its definition. This is necessary as the runtime system searches for the local scope of the currently executing frame or procedure and executes the local procedure if it is found. The forward reference is declared using one of the following formats:\n```\nlocalprocname = procedure returning typeofreturnvalue\nlocalprocname = procedure returning none\nlocalprocname = procedure\n```\nThe `procedure returning none` and `procedure` formats are equivalent, specifying that the procedure does not return a value.\n'
2024-07-18T14:48:35 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat is the use of the callproc statement in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Output\nThe callproc statement in Actian 4GL SQL is used to call a local procedure defined in the current frame or procedure. The runtime system searches the local scopes of the currently executing frame or procedure and executes the local procedure if it is found in the callproc string variable.\n'

To call this procedure from another script or procedure, you can use the `callproc` statement as follows:\n```\ntotal_amount = callproc addtax (tax = taxpercent, price = item_price);\n```\nHere, `taxpercent` and `item_price` are variables containing the tax rate and the original item price respectively. When this script is executed, it will pass these values to the `addtax` procedure and retrieve the total amount with tax applied as the result.\n"

What is the purpose of declaring a forward reference before defining a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Instruction\nFind an answer in the document.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe purpose of declaring a forward reference before defining a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL is to allow you to define the local procedure in the frame, field, procedure, or user class script in which it is called. The declaration must be made in the declare block for the script in which the local procedure is defined.\n2. How do you define a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Instruction\nFind an answer in the document.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nYou define a local 4GL procedure directly in the frame, field, procedure, or user class script using the `procedure` statement as follows:\n```\nprocedure procname [([parameterlist])] =\n[declare\n    localvariablelist\n[enddeclare]]\nbegin\n    statementlist\nend\n[;]\n```\n3.

They specify that the procedure does not return a value.\n4. How do you call a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Instruction\nFind an answer in the document.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nUse the `callproc` statement to call a local procedure defined in the current frame or procedure.

Can you provide an example of a simple local procedure and its usage in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Instruction\nFind an answer in the document and create a brief example.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nHere is an example of a local procedure definition:\n```\nprocedure say_hello (name=char8) =\n{\n    message box ("Hello, " + name);\n}\n```\nThe sample procedure `say_hello` takes one parameter `name`, which is of type `char8`. The caller passes the value of a variable or field to the procedure using this parameter. When you call the procedure, it displays a greeting message with the passed-in name:\n```\nname = "John";\ncallproc say_hello (name); // Displays "Hello, John"\n```'

Before you define a local procedure, you should declare a forward reference because the local procedure is defined within the same script as it's called, and declaring a forward reference ensures that the local procedure can be found and executed by the system when the callproc statement is encountered.\n"

These variables are only accessible within the scope of the procedure where they are defined, making them useful for keeping track of intermediate values or for storing inputs and outputs.\n'
2024-07-18T15:09:00 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nExplain the purpose and use cases for local procedures in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Output\nLocal procedures in Actian 4GL SQL are used to code callable procedures within a single frame, field, procedure, or user class script. The primary advantage of using local procedures is that they allow you to reuse and share common logic across multiple areas in your application without the need for global variables. This makes your code more modular, easier to manage, and less prone to errors due to unintended interactions between different parts of your program.\n\nOne use case for local procedures would be to implement a set of utility functions that can perform common tasks like data validation, calculation, or formatting. For instance, you could create a local procedure that validates the format of an email address or phone number before it is saved in the database. Another example could be creating a procedure that calculates a complex formula based on various input parameters and returns the result to the calling routine.\n\nBy using local procedures, you can encapsulate this logic within a single, easily-maintainable block of code, reducing the overall complexity of your application and making it more maintainable over time.\n\n'
