The basic syntax is:\n\n```sql\n[return_variable =] callproc procedurename [(parameter = expression {, parameter = expression})]\n```\nIn this statement, `procedurename` specifies the name of the 4GL procedure to be called, while the optional parameters allow you to pass values to the procedure."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How do you pass a variable by reference when calling a procedure using callproc statement in Actian 4GL?", "assistant": "To pass a variable by reference when calling a procedure using the `callproc` statement in Actian 4GL, you need to use an address-of operator (`&`) before the parameter name in the calling code. This ensures that the original variable is modified within the called procedure rather than a local copy. For example:\n\n```sql\ncallproc update_record(&my_variable);\n```\nIn this case, `my_variable` is passed by reference to the `update_record` procedure."}

The default value of the undeclared parameter will not be used and the execution of the called procedure will not occur as intended. To avoid such errors, it is essential to ensure that all parameters passed in the `callproc` statement are properly declared in the target procedure."}

When might we need to use it when calling a 4GL procedure?", "assistant": "The Flush method is used in Actian 4GL to refresh or update the values displayed on the form, especially when data is being manipulated during the execution of a script or a 4GL procedure. When calling a 4GL procedure with a reference variable as a parameter and updating its value within the called procedure, you may want to use the Flush method immediately after the callproc statement if you want the updated value to display on the form before the current event block completes. Without the Flush method, the updated value will be displayed only when the event block is finished."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the difference between passing parameters by value and by reference in Actian 4GL? Provide an example for each method.", "assistant": "In Actian 4GL, parameters can be passed by value or by reference. When a parameter is passed by value, a copy of the original variable's value is created and sent to the called procedure. Any changes made to this copy inside the procedure do not affect the original variable in the calling frame. Here is an example of passing a parameter by value:\n```\ndeclare integer number1 := 5;\ncallproc add_numbers(number2 = 3);\nwrite number1;\n```\nIn the above example, the value `5` is passed to the called procedure `add_numbers`. Inside the procedure, a copy of this value is created and incremented by `3`. However, the original variable `number1` remains unchanged. The output will be `5`.\n\nOn the other hand, when a parameter is passed by reference, the called procedure has direct access to the original variable in the calling frame. Any changes made inside the procedure affect the original variable as well. Here is an example of passing a parameter by reference:\n```\ndeclare integer number1 := 5;\ncallproc add_numbers(number1);\nwrite number1;\n```\nIn this example, the variable `number1` is passed directly to the called procedure `add_numbers`, which increments its value. After the procedure finishes execution, the updated value of `number1` (i.e., `6`) will be displayed in the output."}

By default, scalar types (such as integer, real, and character) are passed by value while object types (like structures, classes, and arrays) are passed by reference. However, you can explicitly specify the passing method using the `INOUT` keyword in the procedure header to pass scalar values by reference or using the `ref` keyword for object types to pass them by value."}

The syntax for specifying parameters is:\n\n```sql\n[return_variable =] callproc procedurename [(parameter = expression {, parameter = expression})]\n```\nIn this syntax, *expression* is the value that will be passed to a specific parameter in the called procedure.

Variables in the expression can be any type, including reference variables and array variables.\n\nHere are some examples of calling procedures with specified parameters:\n```sql\ncallproc remove_new_detail(new_details_frames = new_details_frames, details_frame = video.details_frame);\n```\nIn this example, the `remove_new_detail` procedure has two parameters: `new_details_frames` and `details_frame`.
