"How do I declare a global procedure in OpenROAD using Procedure Editor?"\n   Input:\n   <noinput>\n   Output:\n   To declare a global procedure in OpenROAD, you first need to use the Procedure Editor to give it a name and define its return value type. For instructions on this process, you can refer to the Workbench User Guide.\n\n2. "What are the steps to create a local 4GL procedure in OpenROAD?"\n   Input:\n   <noinput>\n   Output:\n   To create a local 4GL procedure in OpenROAD, first declare it directly in the frame, field, or procedure script. Then write the body of the procedure using the `procedure` statement.\n\n3. "How can I register and create database or 3GL procedures in OpenROAD?"\n   Input:\n   <noinput>\n   Output:\n   To register and create database or 3GL procedures, you should use the appropriate Procedure Editor in OpenROAD Workbench. You write 3GL procedures as you would any 3GL program, compile them, and create a dynamic-link library to link them into the application.\n\n4. "Can you provide an example of how to call a procedure using `callproc` statement?"\n   Input:\n   <noinput>\n   Output:\n   To call a procedure in OpenROAD, you can use the `callproc` statement. For instance, if you have a procedure named `myProcedure`, you might call it like this: `callproc myProcedure()`. The exact syntax may vary depending on the type of procedure you are calling.\n\n5. "What is the purpose of the Workbench User Guide when creating global procedures?"\n   Input:\n   <noinput>\n   Output:\n   The Workbench User Guide provides instructions for declaring a global procedure in OpenROAD using the Procedure Editor. This guide will help you understand the process of giving your procedure a name and defining its return value type.'

2024-07-18T16:51:50 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nCan you provide an example of how to write the body of a local 4GL procedure in OpenROAD using the procedure statement? What should be the first line of such a procedure?\n** Output\nIn OpenROAD, you can write the body of a local 4GL procedure using the `procedure` statement. The first line of a local 4GL procedure should start with the keyword 'PROCEDURE'. For example:\n```\nPROCEDURE myProcedure(myParam1 type1, myParam2 type2)\n  <procedure logic>\nEND PROCEDURE;\n```\nIn this example, `myProcedure`, `myParam1`, `type1`, `myParam2`, and `type2` are placeholder names. You would replace them with your specific procedure name and parameter details. The body of the procedure is where you will write the code that performs the operations you want the procedure to carry out.\n"

What's an example of this usage?\n** Output\nTo call a 4GL procedure in OpenROAD, you can use the `callproc` statement. The general structure of the statement is:\n```\nCALLPROC procedure_name (parameters);\n```\nHere is an example of using the `callproc` statement to call a 4GL procedure with no parameters:\n```\nCALLPROC myProcedure;\n```\nIf your procedure takes parameters, you would add them inside the parentheses as shown in the examples above.\n"
