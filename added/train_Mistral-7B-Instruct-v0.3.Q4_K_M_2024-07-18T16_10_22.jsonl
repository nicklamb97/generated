For example, you could write a field script that defines its own local cleanup procedures. In its initialize block it could insert its handles into an array of cleanup procedure handles defined at the frame level. You can create local cleanup procedures for other field scripts as well. Later, at cleanup time, the frame can loop through the cleanup array and use the handle to call each procedure. Here is a simple example:\n```\nlocal handleArray: Array[10] of ProcHandle;\nbegin\n  for i = 1 to 10 do\n    handleArray(i) = CurScriptScope.GetProcHandle(\"MyCleanupProcedure\");\n  end for; // initialize the array with procedure handles\nend;\n...\non Terminate;\n  for i = 1 to 10 do\n    if handleArray(i) then\n      call handleArray(i);\n    end if;\n  end for; // iterate through the array and execute each cleanup procedure using Call method of ProcHandle class.\nend;\n```\nIn this example, a local array of ProcHandle objects is initialized with handles to `MyCleanupProcedure`, which may not be otherwise accessible outside the field script. Later, in the terminate block, the Cleanup procedures are executed using the Call method on each ProcHandle object."}

Let's assume we want to implement a simple event system where events can be registered, removed, and triggered from anywhere in the application. Here's how it could be implemented:\n\n1. Define an `Event` class that contains the necessary information for an event (e.g., event name, callback function handle, event data).\n2. Create a global array of event handlers called `eventHandlers`. Initialize it as empty.\n3. In the framework, provide functions to register and unregister events:\n\n   - `RegisterEvent(eventName, ProcHandle)`: Adds a new event handler ProcHandle to the global array eventHandlers for the specified event name.\n   - `UnregisterEvent(eventName, ProcHandle)`: Removes an event handler ProcHandle from the global array eventHandlers for the specified event name.\n\n4. To trigger an event, loop through the global array eventHandlers and call each registered event handle with the necessary parameters:\n   ```4gl\n   foreach eventHandler in eventHandlers[eventName] do begin\n     eventHandler.Call(eventData); // where eventData contains any additional data associated with the event\n   end;\n   ```\n5. When needed, call the `RegisterEvent` and `UnregisterEvent` functions to register/unregister event handlers accordingly. This way, you can create an extensible framework for event handling that allows developers to add or remove event listeners as desired without modifying existing code."}

Allows field scripts to declare local procedures that can be called from anywhere within the frame. You can create local procedures for other field scripts as well, allowing them to share cleanup logic without polluting the global scope.\n3. Passes procedures to contexts in which they are not otherwise visible, acting like function pointers in the C language. For example, you could pass a ProcHandle object to a third-party library or module, enabling it to call specific 4GL procedures.\n4. Enables you to create custom event handlers that can be attached to objects and executed at specified events, such as when an object is created or deleted. This provides a flexible way to extend the functionality of existing objects without modifying their source code.\n5. Simplifies the creation and management of callback routines, reducing the amount of boilerplate code needed for common tasks like setting up database connections, handling errors, and performing various data operations.\n6. Enables the reuse of procedures across different scripts or applications by making them easily accessible via a ProcHandle object, rather than having to pass around lengthy procedure names as strings or other types.\n7. Provides a way to manage dependencies between procedures by storing multiple handles in an array and executing them sequentially at specified times or under certain conditions. This can help reduce the risk of race conditions and ensure that your application behaves predictably and reliably."}
