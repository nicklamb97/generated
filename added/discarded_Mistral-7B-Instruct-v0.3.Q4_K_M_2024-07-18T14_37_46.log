Examples of these are shown below:\n```c\nint reti() { return 10; } // Returning an integer\ndouble retf() { return 10.5; } // Returning a floating-point value\nchar * rets() { return "Returned from rets"; } // Returning a character string\n```\n'

For example:\n```c\n/* variable declarations */\ntest_float = float;\ntest_integer = integer;\ntest_return = integer\n...\ntest_return = callproc myCproc (test_integer,\n                             byref(test_float));\n```\nThe corresponding C procedure is declared as follows:\n```c\nLong\nmyCproc (ivalue, fvalue)\nlong ivalue; double *fvalue;\n{...\n```\n"

The procedure should be declared with the appropriate data type to match the desired return type. For example:\n```c\nint\nreti()\n{\nreturn 10;\n}\n\ndouble\nretf()\n{\nreturn 10.5;\n}\n\nchar *\nrets()\n{\nreturn "Returned from rets";\n}\n```\n\n'
