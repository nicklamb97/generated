Describe the purpose of the 'Callproc' statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe 'Callproc' statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL is used to call a procedure from a frame, a procedure, or a method for a user class. This includes procedures written in 4GL or another high-level programming language (3GL language such as C or FORTRAN).\n2. Explain the syntax of 'Callproc' statement.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe syntax of the callproc statement in OpenROAD Actian 4GL is `[returnvariable =] callproc procname[(parameterlist)];`. Where, `procname` represents the name of the procedure being called and the optional parameter list can be used to pass parameters by value or reference.\n3. How does the 'Callproc' statement behave when it is executed inside an included application?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen the callproc statement is executed inside an included application, OpenROAD resolves the procedure reference at runtime, as `procname` is a dynamic name.\n4. How to pass parameters by value and by reference in 'Callproc' statement?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nTo pass values by reference to a 4GL or 3GL procedure, use the `byref(variable)` option in the parameter list of callproc statement. For more information, you can refer to the Programming Guide.\n5. What is the difference between 'Callproc' and Execute Procedure Statement?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhile both statements call a procedure, 'callproc' is used for 4GL or 3GL procedures whereas Execute Procedure is used for database procedures."
