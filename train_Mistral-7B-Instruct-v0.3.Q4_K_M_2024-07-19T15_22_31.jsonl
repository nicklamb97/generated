To handle such errors, you can wrap the SQL command execution within a try-catch block and check for specific error codes. For instance:\n```\nstring query = \"DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = @empId\";\nusing (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn);\n    cmd.Parameters.AddWithValue(\"@empId\", 1234);\n\n    try\n    {\n        conn.Open();\n        cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();\n    }\n    catch (SqlException ex)\n    {\n        if (ex.Number == 547) // error number for 'violation of unique key constraint'\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Employee with ID 1234 not found.\");\n        else\n            throw; // rethrow any other error to be handled elsewhere\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the above example, when an employee with id 1234 does not exist, a `SqlException` is caught, and the error number (547) is checked. If it matches the error number for violation of unique key constraint, a custom message is printed to indicate that the employee is not found; otherwise, the exception is re-thrown for further processing."}
