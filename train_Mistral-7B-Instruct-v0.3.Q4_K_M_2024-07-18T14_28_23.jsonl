This is done by declaring the name of the procedure and its parameters in the `declare` block of the script where it will be defined later. The purpose of this declaration is to inform the compiler that the actual implementation of the procedure will follow later in the same script, so it can generate correct error messages if any problems are encountered before the definition."}

The `procname` is the name you give to your procedure, and the parameter list (optional) specifies the input parameters for the procedure.

The first call sets the tax value first (`tax = taxPercent`) and price second (`price = costField`), while the second call does the opposite (`price = costField` and `tax = taxPercent`).
