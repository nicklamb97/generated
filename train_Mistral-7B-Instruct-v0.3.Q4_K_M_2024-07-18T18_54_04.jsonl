You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can we create views based on multiple tables in Actian SQL? If yes, how can we do that?", "assistant": "Yes, it is possible to create views based on multiple tables in Actian SQL. The `create view` statement requires a `select` statement that defines the contents of the view. In this select statement, you can join multiple tables using the `FROM` clause and the appropriate join types. For example:\n\n```sql\ncreate view myview\n    as select employee.name, department.dept_name\n    from employee\n        inner join department on employee.dept = department.id;\n```"}

The view must be based on a single updatable table or view.\n2. All columns must directly map to columns in the base table or view.\n3. The select statement cannot include distinct, group by, union, or having clauses.\n4. Mandatory columns in base tables (not null, not default) cannot be omitted from the view.\n5.

A base table is a physical table that stores and manages data. Operations on views are processed by operations on their underlying tables, whereas operations on base tables directly manipulate the stored data."}

How are data retrievals from them similar or different?", "assistant": "A base table stores real data, while a view is a virtual representation of that data based on a `select` statement. Data retrieval from both sources is similar in that it returns rows and columns of information. However, unlike base tables, views do not store their own physical data. Instead, the data retrieved through views is derived dynamically at query time by executing the underlying `select` statements."}

Can you provide an example of its usage?", "assistant": "The `with check option` clause in Actian SQL ensures that data inserted or updated into a view complies with the view's definition. The primary use case for this feature is to prevent invalid data from being inserted into or updated within the view. Here is an example of its usage:\n\n```sql\ncreate view myview\n    as select *\n    from mytable\n    where mycolumn = 10\n    with check option;\n```\nIn this example, we have created a view called `myview` using the `create view` statement.
