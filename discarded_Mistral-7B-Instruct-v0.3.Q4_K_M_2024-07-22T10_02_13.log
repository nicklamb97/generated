Provide examples and explain the differences in syntax.\n** Input\nIn Actian 4GL, consider this loop that fetches courses based on credit range:\nBEGIN LOOP UNTIL credits >= 6;\n    SELECT course_id, course_name FROM courses WHERE credits = :credits;\n    SET cursor TO DB-CURSOR;\n    WHILE NOT END-OF-DB-CURSOR;\n        SELECT course_description FROM courses WHERE cursor = DB-CURSOR;\n    END WHILE;\nEND LOOP;\n** Output\nIn C#, you would use a for-loop to achieve the same functionality. Here\'s an example:\n```csharp\nfor (int credits = 1; credits < 6; credits++)\n{\n    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n    {\n        connection.Open();\n        using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand("SELECT course_id, course_name FROM courses WHERE credits = @credits", connection))\n        {\n            command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@credits", credits);\n            using (SqlDataReader reader = command.ExecuteReader())\n            {\n                if (reader.Read())\n                {\n                    int courseId = reader["course_id"].GetInt32(0);\n                    string courseName = reader["course_name"].GetString(0);\n\n                    // Fetch the course description using another SQL command and loop\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nIn the C# example above, we initialize the variable `credits` at the start of the for-loop, set the condition to continue the loop until credits < 6 (instead of >= 6), and increment the credits value on each iteration.\nThe differences in syntax are evident when comparing the Actian 4GL LOOP structure with C#\'s for-loop, specifically in terms of how the iterations and conditions are managed.\n\n'
