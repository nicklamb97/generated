The resulting C# class instances are then added to a collection and returned at the end.\n\nIn summary, the `GetCsharpClassesFromOpenRoadXml` method leverages dynamic code generation to create C# classes from OpenRoad XML components, making it possible to automate the process of creating custom C# classes based on the provided structured data in the XML file."}
