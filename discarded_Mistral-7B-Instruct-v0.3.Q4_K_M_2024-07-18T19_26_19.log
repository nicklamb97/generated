Can you explain the locking behavior when using the drop statement?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe drop statement takes an exclusive lock on the specified table, meaning no other users can modify or access that table while it is being dropped.\n\n2. What is the minimum information required to use the drop statement in Ingres?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nTo use the drop statement in Ingres, you need to specify the type of object (table, view, index) to be dropped and the name of the object.\n\n3. What happens if multiple objects with different types are listed for a single drop statement?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIf more than one object is listed and the object type is not specified, only objects of the specified type are dropped. If the object type is specified, Ingres checks to ensure that the objects named are of the specified type.\n\n4.
