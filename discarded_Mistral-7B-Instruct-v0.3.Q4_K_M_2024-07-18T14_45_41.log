Here\'s an example using the `try-catch` structure:\n```\nprocedure my_procedure();\nbegin\n    try\n        open file "my_file";\n        // perform some operations on the file...\n        close file;\n    catch\n        when exception E is file not found;\n            // handle the error gracefully\n            message("File not found");\n        when exception E;\n            // generic error handling\n            message(E.message);\n    end try;\nend;\n```\nIn this example, the `try-catch` block contains some operations that may throw exceptions. If a file not found exception is encountered, the program will show a custom message "File not found". For any other errors, it will display the error message from the exception object.\n'
