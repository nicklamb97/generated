2024-07-19T11:24:35 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nExplain the Money Data Type in OpenROAD programming language (2.0) with examples.\n\nMoney values are an abstract data type in OpenROAD programming language (2.0). These values are significant to two decimal places and store monetary values. For instance, the money value $123.45 can be specified as a character string literal with the format: `$123456` or as an integer/floating point number, which is automatically converted to the money data type upon input.\n\nOn output, money values display as strings of 20 characters with a default precision of two decimal places using the format: `$[-]dddddddddddd.dd`, where $- sign represents negative numbers, if applicable, and [ ] denotes optional characters (the dollar sign). For example, a money value of -123456.78 would display as `-$123456.78`.\n\nThe following environment settings affect the display of money data in OpenROAD:\n- II_MONEY_FORMAT: specifies the character displayed as the currency symbol and whether it appears before or after the amount.\n- II_MONEY_PREC: specifies the number of digits displayed after the decimal point; valid settings are 0, 1, and 2.\n- II_DECIMAL: specifies the character displayed as the decimal point.\n\nFor more information, please refer to the Workbench User Guide.\n\n'

2024-07-19T11:50:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nExplain what is meant by "Logical key" in OpenROAD?\n\nThe logical key data type allows the DBMS Server or your application to assign a unique key value to each row in a table. Logical keys are useful when an application requires a table to have a unique key, and the columns of the table do not comprise a unique key.\n\nThere are two types of logical keys: SYSTEM_MAINTAINED and NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED. The scope of uniqueness for system maintained logical key columns can be specified using the options TABLE_KEY or OBJECT_KEY. TABLE_KEY values are returned as 8-byte strings, and OBJECT_KEY values as 16-byte strings. Values assigned to logical keys that are NOT SYSTEM_MAINTAINED can be done using string literals.\n'
