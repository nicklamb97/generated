Use clear, descriptive variable names.\n2. Break complex procedures into smaller, manageable functions.\n3. Document your code with comments that explain the purpose of each section and what it's doing.\n4. Follow a consistent coding style across your codebase.\n5. Keep error handling separate from business logic when applicable.\n6. Use meaningful messages for user feedback instead of vague or unhelpful error messages.\n7. Regularly review and update your code to improve performance and maintainability.\n8. Test your procedures thoroughly before releasing them into production.\n"

You can adjust the `fetch` statement to fetch more rows if needed.'
