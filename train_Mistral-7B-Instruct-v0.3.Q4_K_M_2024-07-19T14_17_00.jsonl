We then use an `if` statement to check whether both `x` is greater than `3` and `y` is less than `15`. If both conditions are true, a message will be displayed. The output shows that the message \"Both conditions are true\" gets displayed as both `x` (5) is greater than `3`, and `y` (10) is less than `15`."}

Subtraction expression `7 - 4` subtracts the smaller value from a larger one, returning the difference (3). This is used when you want to find the difference between two values or numbers.\n3. Multiplication expression `5 * 8` multiplies two numbers together, resulting in their product (40). Use multiplication expressions for performing calculations that require multiple instances of the same value, such as calculating area or volume.\n4. Division expression `10 / 2` divides the larger number by the smaller one, returning the quotient (5). This operation can be used when you want to find the ratio between two values.\n5. Modulo expression `6 % 3` returns the remainder when dividing a larger number by a smaller number (0 for this example because 6 divided by 3 equals exactly two times three). Modulo expressions are useful in determining whether one number is divisible by another or finding the position of an element within a sequence."}
