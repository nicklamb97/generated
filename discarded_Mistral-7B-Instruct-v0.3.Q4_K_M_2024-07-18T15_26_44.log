Can you provide an example where we can use a procedure with a return value to perform some operation on that value?\n2. How should the parentheses be handled when calling a procedure without passing any parameters in an expression?\n3. What is the difference between using callproc and a procedure within an expression?\n4. Is it possible to manipulate the return value of a procedure that returns a reference variable in expressions? If yes, how?\n5. Can you explain how to use dot notation with a procedure's return value if it's a complex type (e.g., a record)?\n\n1. Here is an example where we can use a procedure within an expression:\n\n```sql\nif error_handler(frm = CurFrame, commit_evt = 'Commit') != ER_OK then\n    resume;\nendif;\n```\nIn this example, the `error_handler` procedure returns a value that determines whether control should be resumed or not in the if statement.\n\n2. When calling a procedure without passing any parameters, you must still include the parentheses even if they are empty. Here is an example:\n\n```sql\nmessage 'Cannot insert graphic into the database. ' +dbms_error_message();\n```\nThe `dbms_error_message` procedure has no parameters, so its name and empty parentheses constitute the expression.\n\n3. The main difference between using callproc and a procedure within an expression is that you do not use the `callproc` keyword when using a procedure in an expression, and you must include the parentheses even if there are no parameters. Using `callproc` is for standalone calls outside expressions.\n\n4. If the return value of a procedure is a reference variable, you can manipulate it as any other reference variable within expressions. For example, you can use dot notation to access a specific attribute or invoke a method on the object. Here's an example:\n\n```sql\ndim r as record;\nr = my_record_procedure();\nmessage 'Value of r.attribute is: ', r.attribute;\n```\nIn this example, `my_record_procedure()` returns a record variable, which we store in the reference variable `r`. Then, using dot notation, we access the attribute of the record `r.attribute`.\n\n5. If the return value is a complex type (e.g., a record), you can use dot notation to access specific attributes or invoke methods on the object, like in the previous example."

Provide an example.\n** Output\nTo call a procedure with no parameters in OpenROAD, simply give the procedure name without any parentheses or parameter list.
