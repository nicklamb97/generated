These practices help improve efficiency, readability, and reduce errors:\n1. Use modular design principles by breaking down the application into smaller, manageable modules (e.g., separate logic for data manipulation, user interfaces, error handling, etc.). This makes it easier to understand and maintain individual components of the application.\n2. Implement clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and modules to make the code more self-explanatory and improve readability. Avoid using ambiguous or misleading names that might confuse other developers working on the same project.\n3. Organize your code into separate files based on logical groupings (e.g., data manipulation, user interfaces, error handling) to make it easier to find specific functionality quickly. This also allows you to better manage dependencies and simplify testing.\n4. Use consistent coding styles and formatting conventions throughout the application to maintain a clean, organized look. Following a coding style guide, such as the Actian 4GL Style Guide, can help ensure that your code is uniform and easy for other developers to understand.\n5. Document your code thoroughly with comments, explaining what each section does, why you made specific decisions, and how the various components work together. This helps new developers quickly grasp the application's purpose and functionality while reducing the risk of errors during maintenance or modifications.\nRefactoring the existing codebase to follow these best practices will make it more organized, efficient, and easier for you and other developers to maintain the application going forward.",
