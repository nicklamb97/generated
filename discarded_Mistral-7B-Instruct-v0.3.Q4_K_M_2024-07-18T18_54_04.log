2024-07-18T18:58:54 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of the with check option clause in the create view statement?\n** Output\nThe `with check option` clause in the `create view` statement ensures that an insert or update to a view produces a row that complies with the view definition's `where` clause qualification. In other words, it prevents violating the conditions defined in the `select` statement used for creating the view.\n\n"
2024-07-18T18:58:54 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nCan we create a view without columns? What are the implications of such creation?\n** Output\nNo, it's not possible to create a view without any columns since each column in a view corresponds to one or more columns from the underlying table(s) used in the select statement. If the view is created without defining columns, it will have no meaningful content.\n\n"

This means it checks if the data being inserted or updated meets the criteria defined by the WHERE clause in the CREATE VIEW statement. If the data does not meet these criteria, the operation will fail.\n'
