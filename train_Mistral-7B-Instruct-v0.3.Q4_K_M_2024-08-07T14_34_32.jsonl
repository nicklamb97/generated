Assign a handle variable to store the reference to the array.\n```c\nSQLHDBC4 hdb;\nSQLHSTMT  hstmt;\nSQLINTEGER handle;\n```\n\n```c\nSQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, hdb, &hstmt);\nSQLSetDescField(hstmt, 0, SQL_DESC_ARRAY_SIZE, sizeof(myArray)/sizeof(int), NULL);\nSQLSetDescField(hstmt, 1, SQL_DESC_ARRAY_STATUS_PTR, myArray, sizeof(int));\nSQLBindCol(hstmt, 1, SQL_C_INT, &handle, 0, SQL_NO_TOTAL);\n```\n3. Use EXEC 4GL statements within an Embedded SQL block to access and manipulate the array in 4GL.\n```sql\nEXEC SQL DECLARE myCursor CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM MY_TABLE;\nEXEC SQL OPEN myCursor USING :myArray;\n```\nIn this example, `myCursor` is a cursor declared within the 4GL routine to access rows from the table `MY_TABLE`.

The original object remains unchanged in the caller's memory space. In contrast, when passing an object by reference using handles, only the handle or pointer to the original object is sent to the target routine. Any changes made to the object within the target routine will affect the original object because they both refer to the same memory location."}

Then pass this handle to your 4GL routine, and use EXEC 4GL statements to manipulate the array as needed. Here's an example of passing a single integer value from 3GL to a 4GL routine:\n\n```c\n// In 3GL code\nEXEC SQL\n    DECLARE myHandle INT;\nEXEC 4gl\n    SET myHandle = 10;\nEXEC SQL\n    PREPARE stmt FROM 'EXEC 4gl SET :handle = :myHandle;';\nEXEC SQL\n    BIND myHandle AS handle;\nEXEC SQL\n    EXECUTE IMPLICIT :stmt;\nEXEC SQL\n    COMMIT WORK;\n```\nIn this example, we set the value of `myHandle` to 10 using an EXEC 4GL statement.

You can do this by checking the status of the SQLCA (SQL Communications Area) structure in your C code after each EXEC 4GL call to ensure that no errors occurred. If an error does occur, you can examine the SQLCA fields to determine the nature and cause of the error so that appropriate action can be taken.\n\nHere's an example:\n```\nresult = execsql( myExecSqlStatement ); /* execute a SQL command */\nif ( sqlca->sqlcode != 0 ) { /* check for errors */\n   printf(\"Error code %d occurred.\\n\", sqlca->sqlcode);\n   exit(-1); /* handle the error appropriately */\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `myExecSqlStatement` is the SQL statement being executed and `result` holds the result of the execution. The `sqlca->sqlcode` field contains the status of the execution, with a value of 0 indicating success. If an error occurs, it will have a non-zero value, which can be used to determine the nature of the error and take appropriate action."}

Here's an example:\n\nIn C:\n```c++\n#include <stdlib.h>\n\nint my_tableHandle; /* declare the integer handle */\nMyTableStruct newRecord = { .field1 = \"New\", .field2 = \"Record\" };\n\n/* obtain the handle for the table */\nmy_tableHandle = openDatabaseTable(\"MyTable\");\n\n/* insert the record using EXEC 4GL statement */\nexec 4gl myInsertProcedure(my_tableHandle, &newRecord);\n\n/* close the table handle */\ncloseDatabaseTable(my_tableHandle);\n```\nIn your 4GL procedure `myInsertProcedure`, you can define and call a sub-procedure to insert the record into the table:\n\n```4gl\ndefine procedure myInsertProcedure (tableHandle as integer, newRecord as MyTableStruct) {\n    insert into MyTable with handle (tableHandle) using :newRecord.field1, :newRecord.field2;\n}\n\nsubprocedure insertIntoMyTable(tableName as character) {\n    def tableHandle as integer;\n    def myRecord as MyTableStruct;\n\n    /* open the specified table */\n    let tableHandle = openDatabaseTable(tableName);\n\n    /* define the record to be inserted */\n    let myRecord$field1 = \"New\";\n    let myRecord$field2 = \"Record\";\n\n    /* insert the new record */\n    insert into MyTable with handle (tableHandle) using :myRecord$field1, :myRecord$field2;\n\n    /* close the table handle */\n    closeDatabaseTable(tableHandle);\n}\n```\nRemember to replace \"MyTable\" and \"MyTableStruct\" with your specific table name and structure, and adjust the code as needed for your specific implementation."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the purpose of EXEC 4GL statements in ESQL/C programs?", "assistant": "EXEC 4GL statements in ESQL/C programs serve as a means to pass objects and arrays between 3GL (such as C or Fortran) and 4GL (such as COBOL or RPG) routines. These statements help integrate the two programming languages, allowing you to leverage the strengths of each language for your application development needs. By using EXEC 4GL statements, you can simplify the data transfer between the two environments, making it easier to write complex applications that involve multiple programming paradigms."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can I use EXEC 4GL statements with other programming languages besides ESQL/C?", "assistant": "While EXEC 4GL statements were specifically designed for use in Embedded SQL for C (ESQL/C) programs, they may potentially be used with other programming languages that provide similar interoperability features. However, the exact syntax and implementation details can vary depending on the specific programming language and platform you're using. For accurate information, always consult your documentation or code examples provided by the vendor or community resources tailored to your programming language of choice."}

This facilitates seamless integration between the two environments for efficient data manipulation and processing tasks."}
