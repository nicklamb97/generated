Dropping a table or view used in a view's definition results in dropping the view.\n\nData retrieval from a view is akin to that from a base table.

It must be a valid object name.\n\n### column_name\n\nSpecifies the name of a column in the view.\n\n### select_stmt\n\nSpecifies a `select` statement that defines the view's contents.\n\n### with check option\n\nPrevents an insert or update to a view that creates a row not complying with the view definition.\n\n## Description\n\nThe `create view` statement uses a `select` statement to define a virtual table (`view`). The view definition is stored in system catalogs. Operations on the view affect the underlying tables. Dropping a table or view used in a view's definition results in dropping the view.\n\nData retrieval from a view is akin to that from a base table. However, updates, inserts, and deletes on views have constraints:\n\n- The view must be based on a single updatable table or view.\n- All columns must directly map to columns in the base table or view.\n- The `select` statement cannot include `distinct`, `group by`, `union`, or `having` clauses.\n- Mandatory columns in base tables (not null, not default) cannot be omitted from the view.\n- Views can have a maximum of 1024 columns.\n\n*Note:* Distributed environments have additional considerations.\n\n## With Check Option Clause\n\nThe `with check option` clause prevents inserting or updating rows in a view that do not meet the view's `where` clause qualification.\n\nFor example, with a view `myview`:\n\n```sql\ncreate view myview\n    as select *\n    from mytable\n    where mycolumn = 10\n    with check option;\n```\n\nAn attempt to update `mycolumn`:\n\n```sql\nupdate myview set mycolumn = 5;\n```\n\nwill fail because the update violates the `mycolumn = 10` qualification.\n\n## Permissions\n\nUsers need privileges to execute `select` statements used in view definitions.\n\n## Locking\n\nThe `create view` statement requires an exclusive lock on the view's base tables.\n\n## Related Statements\n\n- **Drop Statement**\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1\n\nDefine a view of employee data including names, salaries, and manager names:\n\n```sql\ncreate view empdpt (ename, sal, dname)\n    as select employee.name, employee.salary,\n    dept.name\n    from employee, dept\n    where employee.mgr = dept.mgr;\n```\n\n### Example 2\n\nDefine a view using aggregate functions to show the number and average amount of open orders for sales representatives:\n\n```sql\ncreate view order_statistics\n    (sales_rep, order_count, average_amt)\n      as select salesrep, count(*), avg(ord_total)\n      from open_orders\n      group by sales_rep;\n```\n\n### Example 3\n\nDefine an updatable view showing employees in the southern division with check option:\n\n```sql\ncreate view southern_emps\n    as select * from employee\n    where region = 'South'\n    with check option;\n```"
