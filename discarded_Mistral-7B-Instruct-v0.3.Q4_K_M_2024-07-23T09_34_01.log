Your solution demonstrates how to pass multiple parameters to a reported in Actian 4GL OpenROAD. The call statement correctly specifies the report name and uses named parameters for both param1 and param2.\n'

Assume that you have an existing employee table with columns emp_id, emp_name, department, salary, and year as described earlier. You want to create a temporary table 'temp\\_employee' with columns emp\\_id, salary, and dept\\_id and store the relevant data for employees who earn less than 50,000 dollars.\n** Output\n```\n// Create the temporary table named temp_employee\ncreate temp table temp_employee (emp_id integer, salary real, dept_id integer);\n\n// Insert records into the temporary table from employee table based on the given criteria\ninsert into temp_employee select emp_id, salary, dept_id from employee where salary < 50000;\n```\n"

To resolve this error:\n- Make sure to enter a valid name for your stored procedure\n- Check if you have misspelled the procedure name or used case sensitivity\n'
2024-07-23T12:01:08 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat happens when an error occurs during the execution of a call statement in Actian 4GL OpenROAD? How do you handle these errors?\n** Output\nWhen an error occurs during the execution of a call statement, an error message is displayed along with the line number where the error occurred. To handle these errors, you can use error handling techniques such as wrapping your code inside `on-error` and `end-on-error` blocks or using the `raise` and `resolve-error` statements to customize error messages or take corrective actions.\n'
