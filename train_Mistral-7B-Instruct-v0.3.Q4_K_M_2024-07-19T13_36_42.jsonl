By default, variables are not allowed to be null. However, you can explicitly specify whether a variable is nullable or non-nullable by using the keywords `with null` or `not null`. For example:\n```\nmy_string CHARACTER varying(20) with null\n```\nThis line declares a local string variable called 'my\\_string' that can be assigned null values."}

It can be initialized at declaration, but its length cannot be changed during runtime.\n- A collection, on the other hand, is a dynamic collection of elements with a defined data type or class. You can add, remove, or modify its elements during runtime. Collections in Actian 4GL OpenROAD support two types: standard collections and hash tables (also known as dictionaries)."}

This allows you to provide an initial value for the variable or parameter that will be used if it is not explicitly assigned during program execution. The syntax for declaring a local variable with a default value is as follows:\n    *simple_datatype* [length=*number*] [null | not null] **with default** *defaultvalue*\nwhere '*defaultvalue*' is the initial value you want to assign to the variable or parameter.\nHere's an example:\n```\nmy_integer integer with default = 0\n```\nIn this example, the `my_integer` variable is declared with a default value of 0, so if it is not assigned any other value during program execution, it will start with the value 0."}

The optional **with default** clause allows you to provide an initial value for each element in the array, while the **null** and **not null** clauses specify whether the elements can be null or must have a value respectively.\nHere's an example:\n```\nmy_array char array of Person with default = 'Unknown' not null\n```\nIn this example, `my_array` is declared as an array of class Person. Each element in the array is initialized with the string 'Unknown', and the elements must have a value throughout program execution (since the **not null** clause is used)."}

On the other hand, the 'not null' clause specifies that a local variable or parameter cannot accept NULL values and must always have a non-NULL value when declared.\nIt is important to note that when you declare a local variable with the 'with null' clause, you must also make sure that your code checks for null values in any statements where you use this variable.

By setting 'not null', you are telling the system that this variable should never be assigned a null value. On the other hand, if a variable is defined with 'with null', it can accept a null value. This is important because trying to store a null value in a variable that is not defined as accepting null values will result in an error when the program is run."}
