The user is asking about the types of attributes that can be set with the With Clause. The assistant should provide a detailed answer, including examples if possible, to help the user understand the concept.\n<|assistant|>\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD's WITH clause, you can set any attribute of the GhostExec or FrameExec class that is applicable depending on the type of frame being called. Attributes include things like control variables, screen fields, and dialog boxes among many others. For example, you could use the WITH clause to override a default value for a control variable or to change the appearance of a screen field dynamically during runtime.\n"

One real-world scenario where the With Clause would be useful in Actian 4GL OpenROAD is when you need to call a frame from a different database or want to rename the frame for better identification. For example, you might have multiple frames with similar names and to avoid confusion, you can use the With Clause to provide unique names for each instance of the frame.\n<|assistant|>\nIs it possible to set default values for attributes using the With Clause in Actian 4GL OpenROAD? And if so, how?\n<|user|>\nYes, you can set default values for attributes using the With Clause by not assigning a value explicitly. If you don\'t specify an attribute within the With Clause, it will take its default value from the original GhostExec or FrameExec object. For instance:\n```4gl\nDEFINE FRAME my_frame WITH name = "new_name".\n    CALL my_frame.\nEND DEFINE.\n```\nIn this example, the With Clause only sets a new name for the frame, and all other attributes will take their default values from the original GhostExec or FrameExec object.'

In such cases, you would use the With Clause to override the default sorting attribute with an expression that references the desired fields to be sorted.\n\nFor example:\n```bash\nWITH SortOrder = 'Record1.Field1 DESC'\nCall FrameSortRecords\nEND WITH\n```\nHere, the With Clause is being used to override the default sort order by setting a new value for the SortOrder attribute inside the FrameSortRecords frame call. The expression being used in this case is a string specifying the desired field and sorting direction for that specific instance of the FrameSortRecords frame.\n\nAnother example of using the With Clause to modify properties involves altering a frame's behavior during a call based on certain conditions. For instance, you may want a particular report frame to display data in a different format depending on the user logged in. You could use the With Clause to adjust the report formatting attributes according to the current user's preferences:\n```bash\nIF (UserName = 'admin') THEN\n    WITH ReportFormat = 'PDF'\n    Call ReportFrame\nEND IF\nELSEIF (UserName = 'standardUser') THEN\n    WITH ReportFormat = 'CSV'\n    Call ReportFrame\nEND IF\nEND WITH\n```\nIn this example, the With Clause is being employed to change the report format based on the current user. The IF statement checks the UserName attribute, and the With Clause sets the appropriate format for either 'admin' or 'standardUser'.\n"
