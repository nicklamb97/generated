The callframe statement is often used to display dialogs that collect user input relevant to the calling frame.\n\nBecause framename is a dynamic name, you can use an actual frame name or a variable that resolves to a frame name at runtime. If you use an actual frame name, OpenROAD resolves the reference at compile time. If you use a variable, OpenROAD resolves the frame reference at runtime. This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callframe statement is executed inside an included application.\n\nBecause you can nest called frames, the called frame can call another frame, and so on. You can also call frames recursively.\n\nTo exit a called frame, use the return statement. This statement lets you pass a single value back to the calling frame in the return variable.

This difference in the timing of name resolution has an important consequence when the callframe statement is executed inside an included application.\n\nBecause you can nest called frames, the called frame can call another frame, and so on. You can also call frames recursively.\n\nTo exit a called frame, use the return statement. This statement lets you pass a single value back to the calling frame in the return variable. The data type of this variable and the data type of the frame's return value must be compatible. The data types are checked at compile time. (For more information, see the Return Statement.)\n\nYou cannot use the callframe statement in an expression.\n\n## Parameters--Callframe Statement\nThis statement has the following parameters:\n\n### returnvariable\n- Specifies the name of a variable in the calling frame or procedure that receives the return value from the called frame. The data type of returnvariable must agree with the return type of the called frame, which is declared in the property sheet when you create the frame.\n\n### framename\n- Specifies the OpenROAD name of the frame you are calling. It is a dynamic name.\n\n### parameterlist\n- See NamedParameterList.\n\n### withclause\n- See WithClause.\n\n## Examples--Callframe Statement\nCall newframe, passing a value from the simple variable, projnum, of the calling frame to the simple variable, projnum, in the called frame:\n\n```4gl\ncallframe newframe(projnum = projnum);\n```\n\nCall newframe, placing a value in the status variable upon returning to the calling frame:\n\n```4gl\nstatus = callframe newframe;\n```\n\nCall calcframe, passing the simple variable, calc, by reference. On return, the value of calc reflects any changes made to the opexp value by calcframe:\n\n```4gl\ncallframe calcframe(opexp = byref(calc));\n```\n\nCall calcframe, changing the default position of the frame given on its property sheet:\n\n```4gl\ncallframe calcframe(ofexp = byref(calc))\n          with windowxleft = 1000, windowytop = 2000,\n          windowplacement = WP_PARENTRELATIVE;\n```"
