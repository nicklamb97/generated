In C#, you declare your loop control variables within the loop declaration using integer type definitions (e.g., `int i` and `int j`)\n- Actian 4GL does not have a 'continue' keyword like C#. If you want to skip an iteration in Actian 4GL, you can use a conditional statement or a goto statement to achieve the same effect.\n- The way the product of i and j is calculated inside the loops also differs slightly due to the difference between the arithmetic operators `*` for multiplication (Actian 4GL) and multiplication operator `\\*` for string concatenation (C#). In Actian 4GL, you can directly perform arithmetic operations inside the DISPLAY statement. In C#, you need to use string interpolation ($ operator) or concatenation operators (+ operator) to achieve the same effect.\n- Finally, note that in the provided Actian 4GL example, the display statement does not include newline characters for each line. The newlines are added by the implementation itself due to the format of output display in Actian's console. In C#, you need to explicitly add a newline character (\\n) at the end of each output line using Console.WriteLine()."}

In this example, we have two nested loops, where the outer loop initializes the control variable i to 1 and will continue to iterate as long as i is less than or equal to 5. The inner loop initializes the control variable j to 1 and continues until j exceeds 5. Inside each iteration of both loops, we display the values of i and j along with their product (i * j).\n```4gl\nDISPLAY \"Example 4: Nested FOR Loops\"\nFOR i = 1 TO 5\n    DEFINE j INTEGER\n    FOR j = 1 TO 5\n        DISPLAY \"i: \", i, \", j: \", j, \" - Product: \", i * j\n    END FOR\nEND FOR\n```"}

Both languages use a combination of outer and inner FOR loops to iterate through a series of values to create the multiplication table.\n2. In both languages, the control variable (i or j) is initialized and incremented within each loop for the next iteration.\n3. The mathematical operation used in the output statement (`DISPLAY` or `Console.WriteLine()`) calculates the product of the current values of i and j to generate a multiplication table."}

Here's an example:\n```4gl\nFOR counter = input_variable TO output_variable\n    ...\n    ON ERROR error_message\n        DISPLAY \"Invalid range for counter: \", error_message\nEND FOR\n```\nIn this example, when `input_variable` or `output_variable` is not within the acceptable range, the loop will exit and display an appropriate error message.\n\nIn C# (2.0):\n- You can use a try-catch block to handle errors that might occur during the execution of a loop. Here's an example:\n```csharp\ntry\n{\n    for (int counter = int.Parse(input_variable); counter <= int.Parse(output_variable); counter++)\n    {\n        ...\n    }\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n    Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid range for counter: \", e.Message);\n}\n```\nIn this example, when `int.Parse(input_variable)` or `int.Parse(output_variable)` throws an exception due to invalid values, the try-catch block catches it and displays an appropriate error message."}
