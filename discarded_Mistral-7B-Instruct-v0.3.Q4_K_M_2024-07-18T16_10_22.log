The syntax is:\n```4gl\n[retval =] prochandle.Call(parameters);\n```\nThe `parameters` are specified just as in a callproc statement, and the Call method uses the scope specified by the ProcHandle object to execute it.\n\n'

One common use case is defining local cleanup procedures within a field script and storing their handles in an array. Later, during clean-up time, the frame can loop through the array and call each procedure using its handle to execute it. This allows for efficient management of resources by calling cleanup code only when needed.\n\n'

The syntax is:\n```\nprochandle = scope.GetProcHandle(name = string);\n```\nHere, `string` specifies the name of a procedure and `scope` represents the context in which the procedure is visible and should be executed.\n\n'

How is a ProcHandle object used to pass procedures between frames?\n   ** Input**\n   <noinput>\n   ** Output**\n   A ProcHandle object can be used to pass procedures between frames by creating the procedure handle in one frame and passing it to another frame as an argument or storing it in a shared variable. The receiving frame can then use the ProcHandle object to call the stored procedure. Here is an example:\n   ```4gl\n   CreateProc myproc;\n   myproc.Run();     // Define and run the local proc within the current frame.\n   prochandle = CurFrame.Scope.GetProcHandle(Name = 'myproc');  // Create a ProcHandle for the local proc.\n   OpenFrame(otherframe);   // Open another frame.\n   otherframe.SetVar('prochandle', prochandle);  // Pass the ProcHandle to the other frame.\n   otherframe.prochandle.Call();  // The other frame uses the ProcHandle to call the proc.\n```\n\n2. How do you create a ProcHandle object for a local procedure that has the same name as a global procedure?\n    ** Input**\n    <noinput>\n    ** Output**\n    To create a ProcHandle object for a local procedure that shares the same name as a global procedure, use a global scope to represent the current application (CurSession.Scope). Here's an example:\n    ```4gl\n    handle = CurSession.Scope.GetProcHandle(Name = 'procname');  // Use the global scope to resolve the local proc name.\n    ```\n\n3. Can you provide a use case for using ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL SQL?\n     ** Input**\n     <noinput>\n     ** Output**\n     One possible use case for using ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL SQL is to create local cleanup procedures within field scripts and store them in an array of ProcHandle objects. During the cleanup phase, the script loops through the array of ProcHandle objects and calls each procedure using the `Call` method:\n     ```4gl\n     // Define local cleanup procedures for multiple field scripts.\n     CreateProc clear_field1;\n     CreateProc clear_field2;\n\n     // Store the ProcHandle objects in an array.\n     prochandle[0] = CurScriptScope.GetProcHandle(Name = 'clear_field1');\n     prochandle[1] = CurScriptScope.GetProcHandle(Name = 'clear_field2');\n\n     // Loop through the array and call each cleanup procedure during cleanup time.\n     For i = 0 To Length(prochandle) - 1 Do Begin\n         prochandle[i].Call();\n         End;\n     ```\n\n4. What is the difference between calling a local procedure with a ProcHandle object and a callproc statement?\n      ** Input**\n      <noinput>\n      ** Output**\n      The main difference between calling a local procedure with a ProcHandle object and using a callproc statement lies in scope visibility. A `callproc` statement can only call procedures within the current frame or application, whereas a ProcHandle object allows you to call procedures that are visible in different frames and even global procedures. Additionally, ProcHandle objects can be used to call local procedures with the same name as global procedures by specifying their scope explicitly.\n\n5. What happens if a procedure represented by a ProcHandle object is already running when we try to call it again?\n       ** Input**\n       <noinput>\n       ** Output**\n       If a procedure represented by a ProcHandle object is already running when you try to call it again, the second call will be queued and executed once the first call has completed. This is similar to calling multiple instances of the same function in C or other procedural programming languages. However, if the procedure is not designed to handle concurrent executions, unexpected results might occur."

As a standalone statement by itself. For example, `myProcHandle.Call()`.\n2. As the right side of an assignment. For example, `someVariable = myProcHandle.Call()`. This allows you to assign the return value (if any) of the procedure execution to a variable for further use.\n\n'

It can be invoked only in the following places:\n   - In a statement by itself\n   - As the right side of an assignment\n2. It can never be invoked inside an expression.\n3.

On the other hand, using CurSession.Scope represents the current application and it allows creating a ProcHandle object for a global procedure named identically to a local procedure in another application.\n\n2. ** Instruction\n   Can you explain when the Call method can be invoked on a ProcHandle object?\n\n** Input\n   <noinput>\n\n** Output\n   The Call method can be invoked only in the following places:\n   - In a statement by itself\n   - As the right side of an assignment. It can never be invoked inside an expression.\n   If a procedure handle represents a local procedure defined in a frame or global procedure component, there are two additional restrictions on when the Call method can be invoked on the procedure handle:\n   - The Call method cannot be invoked after the frame or global procedure in which it was defined (and which contains the scope on which the GetProcHandle was issued) has terminated.\n   - The Call method cannot be invoked from a "thread" other than the one in which the GetProcHandle was issued. These restrictions do not apply to a procedure handle that represents a global procedure or a local procedure defined in a user class script.\n\n3. ** Instruction\n   How can you create a ProcHandle object for an application\'s global procedure named identically to a local procedure?\n\n** Input\n   <noinput>\n\n** Output\n   To create a ProcHandle object for a global procedure with the same name as a local procedure, use CurSession.Scope (representing the current application) as follows:\n\n```4gl\nprochandle = CurSession.Scope.GetProcHandle(Name = \'procname\');\n```\n   Note that appname must reference an application directly included by the currently active application.\n\n4. ** Instruction\n   Can you provide an example of how to pass parameters to a procedure when executing a ProcHandle object?\n\n** Input\n   <noinput>\n\n** Output\n   To pass parameters when executing a ProcHandle object, use the Call method just like in a callproc statement. For example:\n\n```4gl\nparameter1 = \'value1\';\nparameter2 = 5;\nprochandle.Call(parameter1, parameter2);\n```\n   In this case, parameter1 is passed as a string and parameter2 is passed as an integer.\n\n5. ** Instruction\n   How do you loop through the cleanup array containing ProcHandle objects to call each cleanup procedure?\n\n** Input\n   <noinput>\n\n** Output\n   To loop through the cleanup array containing ProcHandle objects, use a standard loop construct like FOR or WHILE:\n\n```4gl\nfor i = 1 to Size(cleanupArray) do\n    if cleanupArray[i] ne NULL then\n        // Calling the clean up procedure using the ProcHandle object\n        cleanupArray[i].Call();\n    endif;\nendfor;\n```\n   This will call each cleanup procedure stored in the cleanup array.'

Can you provide an example of using ProcHandle objects to define and call cleanup procedures for multiple field scripts?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nYes, you could write a field script that defines its own local cleanup procedures. In its initialize block it could insert its handles into an array of cleanup procedure handles defined at the frame level. You can create local cleanup procedures for other field scripts as well. Later, at cleanup time, the frame can loop through the cleanup array and use the handle to call each procedure. Here is a sample code snippet:\n\n```\nprocedure MyCleanUpProcedure();\n... (implementation)\nend;\n\ndeclare myHandle ProcHandle;\nmyHandle = CurScriptScope.GetProcHandle('MyCleanUpProcedure'); // obtain the handle for this cleanup procedure\nInsert(CleanupArray, myHandle); // store the handle in an array of cleanup procedures\n\n...
