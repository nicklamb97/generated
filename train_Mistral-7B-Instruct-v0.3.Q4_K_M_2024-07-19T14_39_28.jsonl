Use comments to explain complex logic or code that may not be immediately clear to other developers.\n2. Comment out sections of the code when debugging, rather than modifying the code itself to avoid potential errors.\n3. Keep your comments concise and to the point - excessive commenting can make the code more difficult to read.\n4. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables and functions to minimize the need for excessively detailed comments.\n5. Avoid using comments as a substitute for properly structured and organized code - clear structure and indentation should be your first line of defense when it comes to making the code easy to understand.\n6. Remember that comments are not compiled or executed, so don't use them to alter the behavior of the program or fix errors. Instead, focus on fixing any issues in the actual code itself.\n7. If you decide to comment out a large section of code for an extended period of time, consider removing the commented code and adding comments to explain why it was removed, to avoid confusion when others look at the code.\n8. When documenting your code, aim to provide enough information that someone who is unfamiliar with the code can understand its purpose and how to use it effectively."}

For example:\n```\n/* This is a single-line block comment */\n\n/*\n** This is a multi-line block comment that spans multiple lines.\n** It provides a detailed explanation about how to perform a specific task in your 4GL script.\n*/\n```\nIn summary, end-of-line comments are useful for quick notes or explanations about individual lines of code, while block comments can provide more detailed documentation and explanations about larger blocks of code. Both types of comments help improve the readability and maintainability of your 4GL scripts in OpenROAD."}

Documentation: Comments help provide context and explain the purpose of code, making it easier for other developers to understand and maintain your codebase. This is especially important when working on large, complex projects with multiple contributors.\n2. Debugging: Comments can be used to log debug information or to temporarily disable sections of code while troubleshooting issues. This can help you quickly identify and fix problems without making permanent changes to the code.\n3. Organization: Comments can help organize your code and make it easier to read, understand, and navigate. By breaking up long blocks of code with comments that explain what each section does or how it works, you can improve the overall structure and readability of your code.\n4. Maintainability: Comments can help future developers understand your codebase, even if they are unfamiliar with your specific implementation. This makes it easier to maintain and update your code over time, as new team members or contributors can quickly get up to speed on how the code works.\n5. Code Review: If you are collaborating with other developers on a project, comments can help facilitate effective code reviews by providing context, explaining assumptions, and documenting decisions made during the development process. This can make it easier for others to provide constructive feedback and suggestions for improvement.\n6. Long-term Memory Aid: Comments can serve as a long-term memory aid for developers who may forget the specific purpose of certain sections of code or why certain decisions were made during development. By referencing comments when working on an existing codebase, developers can quickly recall important information and make informed decisions about how to modify or extend the code."}

For example:\n```\n//insert into employees(salary, age)\n//values(:salfield, :agefield); // This line is commented out and will not be executed by the Actian database engine\ncommit work;\n```\nIn this example, the commented-out line of code is not being used for any purpose.
