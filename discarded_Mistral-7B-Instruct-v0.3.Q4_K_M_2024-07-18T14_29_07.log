What is the purpose of local procedures in Actian 4GL SQL?\nAnswer: Local procedures can be used to code a callable procedure for a single frame, field, procedure, or user class script in Actian 4GL SQL. They are defined within the script in which they are called, but you must declare a forward reference before defining them.\n2. How do you define a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL?\nAnswer: You can use the following syntax to define a local procedure:\n```\nprocedure procname [([parameterlist])] =\n[declare\n    localvariablelist\n[enddeclare]]\nbegin\n    statementlist\nend\n[;]\n```\n3. What is the role of the forward reference in defining a local procedure?\nAnswer: The forward reference declares the name, returning value type, and parameters (if any) for the local procedure before it is defined. You must put the forward reference in the declare block for the script in which the local procedure is defined.\n4. How do you call a local procedure in Actian 4GL SQL?\nAnswer: You can use the `callproc` statement to call a local procedure defined in the current frame or procedure. For more information see the *Language Reference Guide* online help.\n5. What happens when the runtime system searches for a local procedure?\nAnswer: The runtime system searches through local scopes of the currently executing frame or procedure and executes the local procedure if it is in the `callproc` string variable.'

Explain how to declare a forward reference for a local procedure in OpenROAD.\n** Instruction\nIn order to define a local procedure, you must first declare a forward reference before defining the actual procedure. Use one of the following formats: `localprocname = procedure returning typeofreturnvalue`, `localprocname = procedure returning none`, or `localprocname = procedure`. These declarations go in the `declare` block for the script where the local procedure is defined.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nBy declaring a forward reference, you inform OpenROAD that a local procedure with that name will be defined later on in the script. You have three options for how to declare this forward reference:\n  1. Use `localprocname = procedure returning typeofreturnvalue`, where `localprocname` is the name of your local procedure and `typeofreturnvalue` represents the data type of the value that the procedure will return if it returns a value at all (for example, `integer`, `float`, etc.).\n  2. Use `localprocname = procedure returning none`, which means that your procedure does not return any values.\n  3. Use `localprocname = procedure`, which also signifies that the procedure does not return any values.\n\nRemember to put these declarations in the `declare` block for the script where you will be defining the local procedure.\n\n2. Provide an example of a simple local procedure definition and its usage.\n** Instruction\nCreate a simple example demonstrating how to define and call a local procedure in OpenROAD. This example should include both the function declaration and the function call.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nHere's an example of a simple local procedure, named `my_proc`, which takes two parameters and returns their sum:\n```\nlocal_proc my_proc = procedure(a, b) returning integer;\nbegin\n    declare\n        total: integer;\n    enddeclare;\n\n    total := a + b;\n\n    return total;\nend;\n\n// Call the local procedure and store the result in the variable result.\nresult := callproc my_proc(5, 3);\n```\nThe output of this example would be `8`, since `my_proc` adds the values of its input parameters."

This allows the programmer to define the body of the procedure later in the code, but still be able to call it from elsewhere in the script. The use case for this is when a function needs to be called before it has been fully defined, making it possible to write cleaner and more organized code.\n\n'
