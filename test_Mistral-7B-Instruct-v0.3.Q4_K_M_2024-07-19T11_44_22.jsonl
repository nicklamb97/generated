{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Are simple variables nullable by default in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Yes, by default, all simple variables in OpenROAD are nullable. If you don't want the variable to be nullable,\nyou must include the 'not null' clause in the declaration, for example: i = integer not null;\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can you specify a different default value for a simple variable in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "To specify a different default value, you must include the default clause in the variable declaration. The\ndefault value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the Language Reference Guide.\nFor example: i = integer not null default false;\n"}

For example, to assign the value\n'Smith' to the person variable, you would use the following statement: person = 'Smith';\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can simple variables be elements of reference variables or arrays in OpenROAD?", "assistant": "Yes, individual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables in OpenROAD. For example,\nin a reference variable 'Film' with three attributes, each of these attributes is a simple variable. Similarly,\nin an array 'Movies', each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n"}
