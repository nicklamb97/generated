Provide an example for clarity.\n** Input\nThe following code is meant to assign either 'Good' or 'Bad' as the credit status based on the customer's credit score. If the credit score is greater than 700, then 'Good' should be assigned as the credit status, otherwise 'Bad'.\n```\ncredit_status = (credit_score > 700) ? 'Good' : 'Bad';\n```\n"
2024-08-07T14:58:15 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat happens if you try to change the value of a constant variable in Actian 4GL?\n** Input\nIn my program, I have a constant variable set as follows:\n```\nconstants.max_employees = 100;\n```\nLater on in the code, I try to change its value like this:\n```\nconstants.max_employees = 250;\n```\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL, you cannot modify constant variables once they are defined. If you attempt to reassign a constant variable as shown in the code snippet, it will generate an error. To change the maximum number of employees allowed, you should consider creating and using a regular variable instead.\n'

Explain with an example.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD, a single variable cannot be assigned multiple values directly. However, you can update the value of the variable multiple times. For example:\n```\nage = 18;\nage = 25;\n```\nHere, the "age" variable is first set to 18, and then later it is updated with the value 25.\n'

It allows you to store and manipulate data for further use in your program.\n'
2024-08-07T15:30:32 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat are some best practices for naming variables in Actian 4GL OpenROAD to ensure readability and maintainability of your programs?\n** Output\nNaming variables consistently and descriptively is essential for maintaining code readability and reducing errors:\n1. Use meaningful names that describe the purpose or type of the variable, such as "CustomerName", "OrderTotal", or "TaxRate". Avoid using generic names like "Var1" or "Temp".\n2. Keep variable names short but clear to avoid making them difficult to read. For example, instead of "FullNameWithInitialAndSuffix", you can use a shorter name such as "Full_Name".\n3. Use camelCase notation for variable names by starting the name with a lowercase letter and using uppercase letters for each new word (e.g., FirstName). Avoid underscores, as they can be confusing when used excessively in long names.\n4. Follow your organization\'s naming conventions or programming standards to ensure consistency across different projects and programs.\n'
