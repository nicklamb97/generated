In Actian 4GL, the syntax for defining a while loop includes two main parts: the loop initialization and the loop condition. The structure of a basic `while` loop looks like this:\n```4gl\ndefine [variable] [data-type];\n\nwhile [condition] do\n    -- statements to execute\nendwhile;\n```\nThe variable is initialized at the beginning and will be used within the loop's body. The condition evaluates a logical expression, which determines whether the loop continues or terminates."}
