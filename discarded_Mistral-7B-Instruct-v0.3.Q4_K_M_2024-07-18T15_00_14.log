What is the purpose of using ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL SQL?\n\t* ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL SQL are used to represent global or local procedures and the scope in which they should be executed. They help you in passing procedures between frames or applications, letting called frames call procedures declared locally within their calling frame or even procedures from other frames or applications. This is particularly useful when you want to share reusable code across multiple frames or applications without having to define the procedure in every single frame where it is needed.\n2. How can a ProcHandle object be created in Actian 4GL SQL?\n\t* To create a ProcHandle object, invoke the `GetProcHandle` method on a Scope object. The syntax is:\n```4gl\nprochandle = scope.GetProcHandle(name = string);\n```\nThe `string` specifies the name of the procedure and `scope` specifies where it should be visible or executed, which can be CurScriptScope (the context of the currently executing field script), CurFrame.Scope, or CurSession.Scope for a global procedure.\n3. What are some common uses of ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL SQL?\n\t* Common uses of ProcHandle objects include letting called frames call procedures declared locally in their calling frame and letting field scripts declare local procedures that can be called from anywhere in the frame. They help you pass procedures to contexts in which the procedure is not otherwise visible, similar to function pointers in C language.\n4. How can you execute a ProcHandle object in Actian 4GL SQL?\n\t* To execute a procedure specified by a ProcHandle object, invoke the `Call` method defined for the `ProcHandle` class:\n```4gl\n[retval =] prochandle.Call(parameters);\n```\nThe parameters are specified just as in a callproc statement. The Call method uses the scope specified by the ProcHandle object to execute it.\n5. What are some restrictions for using the `Call` method in Actian 4GL SQL?\n\t* The `Call` method can be invoked only in the following places:\n\t\t- In a statement by itself\n\t\t- As the right side of an assignment. It cannot be invoked inside an expression. If a procedure handle represents a local procedure that was defined in a frame or global procedure component, there are two additional restrictions on when the `Call` method can be invoked on the procedure handle:\n\t\t- The `Call` method cannot be invoked after the frame or global procedure in which it was defined has terminated.\n\t\t- The `Call` method cannot be invoked from a "thread" other than the one in which the `GetProcHandle` was issued. These restrictions do not apply to a procedure handle that represents a global procedure or a local procedure defined in a user class script.'

For example, let's say you have a module containing utility functions that should be reusable across multiple forms in your application. You can create ProcHandle objects for these utility functions and pass them as parameters to each form. The forms can then call the utility functions using the ProcHandle objects when necessary:\n```4gl\n// create a ProcHandle object for utility function 'my_utility_function'\nprochandle = CurFrame.Scope.GetProcHandle('my_utility_function');\n\n// pass the ProcHandle object to form1 as a parameter\nform1(prochandle);\n\n...\n\n// in form1, call the utility function using the ProcHandle object\nmy_utility_function(); // the ProcHandle.Call method is called internally by the 4GL engine\n```\n"

2024-07-18T15:43:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nWrite an example of using ProcHandle objects in OpenROAD to manage cleaning up resources from multiple field scripts.\n** Output\nHere's an example demonstrating how ProcHandle objects can be used for managing cleanup tasks across various field scripts:\n\n1. Define a global array (cleanupArray) within the main frame script that will store all local clean-up procedure handles.\n2. Within each local field script, define its own cleanup procedures and add them to the cleanupArray using the `GetProcHandle` method. This ensures that these specific clean-up tasks are invoked only when necessary:\n```4gl\n// Example of a field script's cleanup procedure\nOn CleanUp {\n    // Perform any necessary cleanup tasks for this field script\n}\n\n// Add its handle to the global cleanupArray\ncleanupArray.Append(CurFrameScope.GetProcHandle('MyFieldScript!OnCleanUp'));\n```\n3. When the main frame cleans up, it can loop through the cleanup array, calling each clean-up procedure using the `Call` method:\n```4gl\nFor i = 1 To cleanupArray.Count {\n    // Execute the corresponding cleanup procedure\n    cleanupArray[i].Call();\n}\n```\nBy utilizing ProcHandle objects and defining local cleanup procedures for each field script, this technique allows you to maintain proper cleanup of resources in a more organized fashion compared to relying on individual field scripts to manage their own clean-up tasks.\n"
2024-07-18T15:43:57 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nList the use cases when using ProcHandle objects is beneficial in OpenROAD.\n** Output\nUsing ProcHandle objects in Actian 4GL SQL offers several advantages:\n1. Local procedures can be called from other frames or global procedures, allowing code to be reused across different parts of an application.\n2. Field scripts can declare local procedures that can be easily accessed and executed within their frame context.\n3. ProcHandle objects enable the passing of procedures to contexts where they may not otherwise be visible, similar to function pointers in other programming languages like C.\n4. ProcHandle objects simplify the management of cleanup tasks across multiple field scripts by allowing them to be stored in an array and executed collectively when needed.\n5. In general, ProcHandle objects promote better code organization, reusability, and performance optimization within Actian 4GL SQL applications.\n'
