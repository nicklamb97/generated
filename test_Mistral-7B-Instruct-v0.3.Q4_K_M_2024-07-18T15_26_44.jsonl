Simply give the procedure name\nfollowed by the parameter list. For example:\n```\nif error_handler(frm = CurFrame, commit_evt = 'Commit') != ER_OK then\n    resume;\nendif;\n```\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can you use procedures that return complex types in expressions?", "assistant": "Yes, procedures can return complex types, and you can use their return values in expressions as long as the\noperations are compatible with the return type.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Is there any difference in calling a procedure within an expression compared to using callproc?", "assistant": "When calling a procedure within an expression, you do not use the callproc keyword and must include the\nparentheses, even if no parameters are passed. Using callproc is for standalone calls outside expressions.\n"}
