{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What does the fetch statement do?", "assistant": "The fetch statement retrieves a row from an open cursor, loads it into 4GL variables, moves the cursor forward\none row, and sets the State and RowCount attributes of the CursorObject class.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does the fetch statement interact with the cursor?", "assistant": "The fetch statement moves the cursor forward one row in the result table and puts the values from the specified\ncolumns into the specified variables.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "When must you specify column names in the fetch statement?", "assistant": "You must specify column names when you fetch column values out of order, that is, not in the same order they\nwere specified in the select statement.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What happens if the fetch statement is successful?", "assistant": "If the fetch statement is successful, 4GL sets the value of the iirowcount system variable to one, and the\nretrieved row becomes the current row.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What happens if the fetch statement is unsuccessful or there are no more rows to fetch?", "assistant": "If the fetch statement is unsuccessful or there are no more rows to fetch, 4GL sets iirowcount to zero, does\nnot change the variables, and sets the State attribute to CS_NO_MORE_ROWS.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What must you do if the select expressions in the open statement exceed the variables in the fetch statement?", "assistant": "The fetch statement can contain fewer variables than select expressions, but it cannot contain more. The data\ntypes of the variables and the values assigned must be compatible.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can you check if there are more rows to fetch after each fetch statement?", "assistant": "You can check the State attribute of the CursorObject. If it is set to CS_NO_MORE_ROWS, there are no more rows\nto fetch.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What should you do to find out how many rows have been successfully fetched?", "assistant": "Check the RowCount attribute of the CursorObject class. It is set to zero whenever the cursor is opened and\nincrements after each successful fetch.\n"}
