Here's an example:\ncharvar [not] like pattern [escape escapechar]\nIn this syntax, the `charvar` represents any character variable, and the `pattern` specifies a string pattern for comparison with the character variable. The optional `[not]` keyword negates the result (if included). The `[escape escapechar]` is used when special characters are present in the pattern, such as `_`, `%`, or `[]`.\nHere's an example using the `like` operator with pattern matching:\ndept = 'Mktg';\nif dept like 'M_[kKtT]' then\n    msg = 'Department name matches pattern.';\nelse\n    msg = 'Department name doesn\\'t match the specified pattern.';\nendif;\nIn this example, the `like` operator compares the value of the `dept` variable with the pattern 'M_[kKtT]'. The square brackets around `k`, `K`, `t`, and `T` allow for uppercase and lowercase characters. If the department name matches any one of these variations (including a single character), the message will be \"Department name matches pattern.\""}
