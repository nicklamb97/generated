The \"department\" field is empty (or NULL) for some employees. To ensure that the department name is always provided, even if it's missing for certain records, you can use the `ifnull()` function in a SQL statement like this:\n\n```sql\nSELECT first_name || ' ' || last_name AS full_name, ifnull(department, 'Unknown Department') AS department FROM employees;\n```\nIn this example, `ifnull(department, 'Unknown Department')` checks the \"department\" column for null values and assigns \"Unknown Department\" as the value if it is empty. As a result, the final output for every record will have a department name assigned to it, even if it's NULL in the original data."}

On the other hand, if you use this SQL statement to obtain the same result but execute it on the database server:\n```sql\nSELECT :ld_date = DATE('now'); // returns the server current date and time\n```\nThe returned value will reflect the current date and time of the database server rather than the client machine. This can be important when dealing with data that needs to be synchronized across multiple locations or systems.\n\nIt's essential to consider factors like network traffic, potential data inconsistencies due to different times or locales, and the load on both the client and server machines while deciding whether to execute a function on the client side or the database side."}
