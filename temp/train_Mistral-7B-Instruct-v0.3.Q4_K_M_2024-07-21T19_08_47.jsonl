Provide an example of how to catch specific exceptions and rehandle them appropriately.", "assistant": "When working with databases or user input, it's essential to handle exceptions to ensure proper error handling and recovery. In the following example, we'll demonstrate how to catch a SqlException (database-related error) and rethrow it as a custom exception:\n\n```csharp\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))\n{\n    try\n    {\n        using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(\"SELECT * FROM accounts\", connection))\n        {\n            connection.Open();\n            var reader = command.ExecuteReader();\n            while (reader.Read())\n            {\n                // Your code to process the reader\n            }\n        }\n    }\n    catch (SqlException e)\n    {\n        throw new CustomDatabaseErrorException(e);\n    }\n}\n```\nIn this example, a SqlCommand is created and executed to retrieve data from the \"accounts\" table. If a database error occurs during execution, the SqlException will be caught, wrapped in a CustomDatabaseErrorException, and rethrown. This way, you can customize your error handling according to your needs, and provide more user-friendly or appropriate messages to users when things go wrong."}

Database interaction: Actian 4GL has built-in database functionality, whereas developers need to use separate libraries or ADO.NET for database interaction in C#, potentially leading to added complexity.\n4. Performance optimization: The performance of converted code may not match the original 4GL version due to differences in language constructs and libraries used between the two languages.\n5.

The Actian 4GL elements are described below along with their C# equivalents:\n\n- `DEFINE VAR myData AS TABLE OF RECORD_TYPE USING SQL-92` - A 4GL variable called `myData`, which is a table containing records of the type `RECORD_TYPE`. The `USING SQL-92` clause indicates that the table's structure is based on a SQL-92 standard table definition.\nIn C#, this equivalent to creating a DataTable and filling it with data from a database query. Here's how you might do it:\n```csharp\nusing System.Data;\n\n// Query string containing the SELECT statement.\nstring query = \"SELECT my_field1 AS myField1, my_field2 AS myField2 FROM my_table\";\n\n// Create a DataTable and fill it with data from the query.\nDataTable myData = new DataTable();\nusing (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(\"Your Connection String\"))\n{\n    using (SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(query, connection))\n    {\n        connection.Open();\n        myData.Load(command.ExecuteReader());\n    }\n}\n```\n- `FETCH NEXT FROM myData` - This 4GL statement retrieves the next record from the table `myData`.\nIn C#, there isn't a direct equivalent for this statement since you can access the data in a DataTable using an index or loop through the rows.
