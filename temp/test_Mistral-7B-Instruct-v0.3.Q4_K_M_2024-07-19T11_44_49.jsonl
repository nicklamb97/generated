You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What does it mean that OpenROAD application components share the same name space?", "assistant": "In OpenROAD, sharing the same name space means that components are identified strictly by name, without\nconsidering the context in which the name is used. This applies to variables, named constants, frames,\nprocedures, and classes.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the order in which OpenROAD searches for names?", "assistant": "OpenROAD searches for names in the following order:\n1. Current event block, local procedure, or user class method\n2. Current field script\n3. Enclosing field scripts\n4. Current frame, global procedure, or user class script\n5. Current application\n6. Included applications (in the order they were included)\n7. Core library\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How can you direct OpenROAD to search only within a specific application?", "assistant": "To direct OpenROAD to search only within a specific application, you can qualify the component name with the\napplication's name using the syntax: application_name!component_name\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does dynamic frame and procedure name resolution differ from the usual search order?", "assistant": "In dynamic frame and procedure name resolution, OpenROAD first searches the currently executing component\nfor a local procedure with the specified name. If not found, it then searches for a global component. The\nglobal search starts with the topmost running application, allowing included applications to call frames\nfrom including applications.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What is the behavior difference between dynamic and explicit name resolution?", "assistant": "Dynamic name resolution (using variables) allows for more flexibility and can call frames across different\napplications, while explicit name resolution is more restrictive and can lead to compile errors when trying\nto call frames from other applications.\n"}
