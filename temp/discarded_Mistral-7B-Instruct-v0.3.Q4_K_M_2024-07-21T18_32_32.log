Potential issue: Differences in syntax, object-oriented programming (OOP) structure, and error handling between the two languages. Mitigation: Carefully review the existing 4GL code and identify key functions that require conversion. Create a plan for each function to map similar functionality in C# while maintaining the same logic and behavior.\n2. Potential issue: Differences in database connections and queries, such as SQL syntax or parameter binding. Mitigation: Use appropriate data access libraries like Entity Framework or Dapper, which provide a more convenient way of querying and handling the database while minimizing differences in syntax.\n3. Potential issue: Inconsistent naming conventions, coding standards, and code organization. Mitigation: Apply consistent naming conventions, follow established C# best practices for coding standards, and maintain clear code organization to facilitate easy understanding of the converted code.\n4. Potential issue: Lack of familiarity with the target language (C#) by team members involved in the conversion process. Mitigation: Provide training sessions or resources on C# programming fundamentals, OOP principles, and common libraries/frameworks used in .NET applications. This ensures that everyone has a solid understanding of the target language and can effectively contribute to the conversion process.\n5.

Mitigation: Perform profiling and benchmarking tests on the converted code to identify performance bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and minimize potential issues that may affect application performance.\n6.

This assumption leads to inefficient or incorrect code due to differences between the two languages in terms of error handling, connection management, and query optimization. To avoid this issue, learn about best practices for data access using ADO.NET in C#, understand any potential compatibility issues with your database provider, and test the converted code thoroughly.\n"

Provide examples of these Actian 4GL data types and their corresponding C# data types.\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL, some commonly used data types include CHAR, DATE, TIME, and INTEGER. These have equivalent data types in C#:\n\n- CHAR is converted to string (System.String) in C#\n- DATE is typically represented by the DateTime struct in C# (System.DateTime)\n- TIME can be mapped to TimeSpan (System.TimeSpan) in C# when dealing with time intervals\n- INTEGER is converted to int (System.Int32) in C#\n\nWhen converting data types, pay attention to any differences in the way values are stored and handled between Actian 4GL and C#, such as string lengths or datetime formats, to ensure accurate conversions.\n'

Create a new C# class with the cursor name. For example, `EmployeeCursor`.\n2. Define instance variables for each column in the query (employees in this case).\n3. Use properties or auto-properties to provide read/write access to these instance variables.\n4. Define methods for accessing the cursor data. This can include:\n   - A method to initialize the C# class with a DataTable containing the data from the cursor.\n   - A method to move to the next row in the cursor (equivalent to Fetch Next in 4GL).\n   - A method to check if there are more rows to retrieve.\n5. Use the C# DataAdapter and SQLConnection classes to execute the query and fill the class instance with data from the cursor.\n6. Implement error handling to manage exceptions that may occur during the execution of the query or filling the class instance.\n7.
