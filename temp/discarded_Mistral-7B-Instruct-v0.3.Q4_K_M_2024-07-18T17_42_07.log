Describe what the `alter role` statement does, with a brief explanation of its syntax.\n   ** Input**\n   <noinput>\n   ** Output**\n   The `ALTER ROLE` statement is used to change the attributes associated with a role identifier in Actian 4GL SQL. Its syntax is as follows:\n\n   ```sql\n   alter role role_id {, role_id} [with with_option {, with_option}];\n   ```\n\n2. List and explain two of the parameters used in the `ALTER ROLE` statement.\n   ** Input**\n   <noinput>\n   ** Output**\n   - `role_id`: Specifies an existing role ID created with the `CREATE ROLE` statement. If one or more of the specified role identifiers do not exist, the DBMS Server issues a warning, but all valid role identifiers are processed.\n   - `role_password`: Defines the password for the role. If no password is specified, any session has access to the specified role identifier and its associated permissions.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `with_option` parameter in the `ALTER ROLE` statement? Give two examples of the options that can be used with this parameter.\n   ** Input**\n   <noinput>\n   ** Output**\n   The `WITH OPTION` clause specifies one of the following password options:\n   - **nopassword**: Removes the password associated with a role.\n   - **password = 'role_password'**: Changes the password for a role to the specified value.\n\n4. What privileges are required to execute the `ALTER ROLE` statement?\n   ** Input**\n   <noinput>\n   ** Output**\n   You must have maintain_users privilege and be connected to the iidbdb database, and you must have maintain_audit privilege to change security audit attributes.\n\n5. What happens when you execute an `ALTER ROLE` statement in Actian 4GL SQL?\n   ** Input**\n   <noinput>\n   ** Output**\n   Executing the `ALTER ROLE` statement locks pages in the iirole catalog of the iidbdb, which can cause sessions attempting to connect to the server to suspend until the statement is completed."
