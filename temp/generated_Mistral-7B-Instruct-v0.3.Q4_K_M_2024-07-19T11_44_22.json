A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable.

If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause.

For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable.

            "# Simple Variables\n\nA simple variable is a single data item. It contains only one value. A simple variable can be any of the basic data \ntypes, such as integer or varchar, with the exception of table_key and object_key as described in Data Types.\n\n## How You Can Declare Simple Variables\n\nThe syntax for declaring a simple variable is:\n\n*name* = *datatype* [with null|not null] [not default|with default|[with] default *defaultvalue*]\n\nThe following example shows a local variable declaration for an integer variable:\n\n```\ni = integer;\n```\n\nBy default, all simple variables are nullable. If you do not want the variable to be nullable, you must include the \nnot null clause in the declaration, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null;\n```\n\nBy default, all numeric simple variables are assigned a default value of zero, and all character simple variables are \nassigned a default value of the empty string (''). If you want to specify a different default value, you must include \nthe default clause. The default value must be null, a literal, or one of the system constants defined in the \n*Language Reference Guide* online help, for example:\n\n```\ni = integer not null default false;\n```\n\nThe with null, not default, and with default (without a value) clauses are provided for syntactic compatibility with \nSQL, but they have no effect in OpenROAD.\n\n## How You Can Use Simple Variables\n\nTo make use of a simple variable, use the variable name. For example, to assign the value of Smith to the person \nvariable, use the following statement:\n\n```\nperson = 'Smith';\n```\n\nIndividual elements in a reference variable or an array can be simple variables, as shown in the illustration in \nVariables. In this illustration, Film is a reference variable with three attributes. Each of these attributes is a \nsimple variable. Similarly, Movies is an array and each individual element in the array is a simple variable.\n\nIn a 4GL script, you can use simple variables as reference or array variable elements in any context that you can use \nother simple variables, for example:\n\n```\nfilm.Director = 'Hitchcock';\nif movies[].Title = 'ANNIE HALL' then ...\n```\n\nIn the first example, film.Director is a simple variable that is an element of a reference variable. In the second, \nmovies[].Title is a simple variable that is an element of an array.\n\nFor information about referencing the individual elements in a reference or array variable, see Reference Variables \nand Dynamic Array Variables."
