Here are some examples of what can be done using the alter group statement:\n1. Add users to a specific group ID with `add users (user_id {, user_id})`.\n2. Drop one or multiple users from a specific group ID with `drop users (user_id {, user_id})`.\n3. Drop all users from a specific group ID with `drop all`.\nPlease provide examples for these actions if possible.\n<|assistant|>\nCertainly! Here are some examples using the alter group statement:\n1. Add users to the group `sales_clerks`:\n```sql\nalter group sales_clerks add users (dannyh, helent);\n```\n2.

If a specified *user_id* is not in the group user list, an error is issued when using 'drop users (*user_id*)', but it continues with the remaining *user_ids*.

For example:\n```sql\nalter group sales_clerks\n    add users (dannyh, helent);\n```\nThis will add both users `dannyh` and `helent` to the `sales_clerks` group.\n'

However, this operation cannot be performed in the same alter group statement. You need to perform this operation separately for each group. Here is an example:\n```sql\nalter group group1\n    drop users (dannyh);\nalter group group2\n    drop users (dannyh);\n```\nThis will remove user `dannyh` from both groups `group1` and `group2`.\n'
