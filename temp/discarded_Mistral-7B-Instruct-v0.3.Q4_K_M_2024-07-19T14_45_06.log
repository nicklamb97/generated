You want to find and process transactions that occurred in the last week and have an amount greater than or equal to 500 USD. Processing these transactions involves adding a 5% processing fee.\n** Output\nHere\'s the Actian 4GL code for the conditional loop:\n```\ndefine cursor cursorTransactions as select * from transactions where date >= today() - 7 and amount >= 500;\n\nwhile not eof(cursorTransactions) do begin\n    let processingFee = 5 / 100 * transaction_amount;\n\n    update transactions set amount = amount + processingFee where cursor_position = cursorTransactions;\n\n    advance cursorTransactions;\nend while;\n```\nThis code creates a cursor for the matching records, calculates the processing fee based on a percentage, applies it to the transaction amount, and updates the records in the database.\n'

2024-07-19T16:36:42 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nWhat is short-circuiting evaluation in Actian 4GL OpenROAD If Then Else Statement? Can you provide an example of using it in your code?\n** Output\nShort-circuiting evaluation is a feature where the expression following the logical operator OR (||) or AND (&) will not be evaluated if the result can already be determined based on the value of the previous expression. This results in performance improvements as unnecessary evaluations are avoided.\n\nHere's an example of using short-circuiting evaluation:\n```\nif age >= 18 && has_license then\n    car = prompt 'Enter your preferred car';\nelse\n    message 'You need to pass the driving test first';\nend if;\n```\nIn this code, if the value of `age` is less than 18, the value of `has_license` does not matter as the result can already be determined. This avoids the unnecessary evaluation of `has_license`.\n\n"
