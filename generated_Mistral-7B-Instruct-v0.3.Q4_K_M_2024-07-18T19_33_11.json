Other valid existing group_ids in the statement are deleted.\n\n## Syntax\n\n```\ndrop group group_id {, group_id};\n```\n\nA group identifier must be empty, that is, have no users in its user list, before it can be dropped. If an attempt is made to drop a group identifier that still has members in its user list, the DBMS Server returns an error and does not delete the identifier. However, the statement is not aborted. Other group identifiers in the list, if they are empty, are deleted. (Use the alter group statement to drop all the users from a group's user list.)\n\nAny session using a group identifier when the identifier is dropped continues to run with the privileges defined for that group.\n\nFor more information about group identifiers, see the Ingres Database Administrator Guide.\n\n## Parameters\n\nThis statement has the following parameter:\n\n- **group_id**: Specifies the group to be dropped. A group identifier must be empty, that is, have no users in its user list, before it can be dropped.\n\n## Permissions\n\nYou must have MAINTAIN_USERS privilege and be connected to the iidbdb database.\n\n## Locking\n\nThe drop group statement locks pages in the iiusergroup catalog of the iidbdb.\n\n## Related Statements\n\n- Alter Group Statement\n- Create Group Statement\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following are drop group statement examples:\n\n1. Drop the group identifier, acct_clerk.\n\n```\ndrop group acct_clerk;\n```\n\n2.
