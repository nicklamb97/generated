2024-07-18T18:01:39 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat happens if I run an implicit commit statement and then issue an explicit one?\n\n<|user|>\nCorrect output: If you issue an explicit commit statement after running an implicit one, the explicit commit will confirm the changes made by the implicit commit. The explicit commit also ensures that all changes made during the transaction are committed to the database.\n\n'
2024-07-18T18:07:02 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n1. Explain the purpose of using the `commit` statement in Actian 4GL SQL.\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe `commit` statement is used to terminate a current database transaction and commit any changes made by the transaction. It is essential when you want to ensure that your changes are saved permanently in the database.\n2. How can you tell if a commit statement was successful or not?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nIf the commit statement is successful, it sets the system variable `IIerrornumber` to zero. Otherwise, it sets `IIerrornumber` to the appropriate error number. In both cases, `IIrowcount` is set to -1. You can check these system variables to determine if the commit was successful or not.\n3. What is the optional `work` keyword used for in Actian 4GL SQL?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nThe `work` keyword is used for compatibility with some versions of SQL. It has no effect on the functionality of the `commit` statement when it is omitted. However, if you are using an older version of Actian 4GL SQL that requires the `work` keyword, it must be included in the `commit` statement.\n4. What happens if autocommit is enabled during a database transaction?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nWhen autocommit is enabled, the database automatically commits each database statement when it completes successfully. This means that each change you make to the database is immediately saved without the need for explicit `commit` statements. However, this can be risky if an error occurs during a transaction because there will be no opportunity to roll back the changes before they are committed.\n5. How do you create an event block that gives the user a choice to commit or rollback changes?\n** Input\n<noinput>\n** Output\nTo create an event block that gives the user a choice to commit or rollback changes, use the `on terminate` event and write an appropriate conditional statement. Here is an example:\n```sql\non terminate = begin\n    if CurFrame.ConfirmPopup(messagetext =\n        'Commit database changes?') = PU_OK then\n        commit work;\n    else\n        rollback work;\n    endif;\nend\n```\nThis event block will show a message to the user asking if they want to commit their changes, and based on their response, it will either commit or roll back the changes before the frame closes."

2024-07-18T18:08:03 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nExplain when a developer should use an explicit commit statement instead of relying on autocommit.\n** Output\nA developer should use an explicit commit statement instead of relying on autocommit when they want to make sure that the current database transaction is committed intentionally. This is useful in cases where the developer wants to ensure that changes made by the transaction are permanent and cannot be undone. On the other hand, if the default for autocommit is turned on, the database will automatically commit each database statement when it completes successfully.\n'

However, the document does not provide information about specific error numbers for a failed commit statement. To find this information, you should refer to the Programming Guide or other relevant documentation.\n'

However, it's important to note that this behavior depends on whether autocommit is enabled or not. If autocommit is turned off, no commits will be performed unless an explicit commit statement is issued.\n"

It is typically used if an error occurs during a transaction, and the user wants to undo any changes made before committing the transaction. For example, if there's an attempt to insert duplicate data into a table, a rollback command can be used to reverse the insert operation.\n"
