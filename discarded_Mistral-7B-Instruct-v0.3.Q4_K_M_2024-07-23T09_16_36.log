2024-07-23T11:26:40 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n** Instruction\nExplain how to handle exceptions (errors) in Actian 4GL OpenROAD, providing examples of common exception types and recommended handling strategies.\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD, exceptions (or errors) can occur during the execution of your application due to various reasons such as invalid data inputs, missing files, or unexpected conditions. Properly handling exceptions is crucial for ensuring your application remains stable and robust in the face of unexpected events.\nHere's an example that demonstrates how to handle common exception types in Actian 4GL:\n1. FileException: When working with files, errors such as file not found or read/write failures can occur. To handle these exceptions, you can use the `try...catch` statement, as shown below:\n```\ndeclare myFile as file-stream;\nopen-file(myFile) for input from 'example_file.txt';\nread(myFile) into a_line; // Try to read data from the file.\nif (myFile.eof()) then\n    close(myFile);\n    write('Reached end of the file.');\nelse if (myFile.error_status() ne 0) then\n    close(myFile);\n    declare ex_info as exception-info;\n    get-exception-info(ex_info, myFile);\n    write('Error while reading from the file:');\n    write(ex_info.message()); // Display error message.\nend if;\nclose(myFile);\n```\n2. DivisionByZeroException: When performing division operations, a `DivisionByZeroException` can occur when you attempt to divide by zero. To handle this exception, use the following approach:\n```\ndeclare num1 as decimal(10, 2) = 5;\ndeclare num2 as decimal(10, 2);\ndeclare result as decimal(10, 2);\nread(input-prompt('Enter number to divide by')) into num2;\nif (num2 ne 0) then\n    result = num1 / num2;\nelse\n    write('Error: Division by zero is not allowed.');\nend if;\nwrite('Result:', result); // Display the result.\n```\nBy handling exceptions properly, you can ensure that your Actian 4GL application remains stable and error-free even when faced with unexpected situations.\n"
