How do you modify your existing code to handle errors gracefully and log meaningful information about them?", "assistant": "To handle errors and exceptions when making an OpenROAD call in Actian 4GL, you can use the \"on error\" clause to specify actions that will be executed in case of errors or exceptions. Additionally, you can check for specific error codes to better understand what went wrong. Here's how you can modify your existing code to log meaningful information about errors:\n```\nopen db connection to my_database;\nbegin;\n  call openroad('sh', arg = \"/usr/bin/sh -c '/path/to/external_script'\");\non error;\n  write-log(get-errorcode());\n  write-log(get-errormsg());\nend;\nclose db connection;\n```\nSome useful error codes to look out for in Actian 4GL OpenROAD calls are:\n- Error code 2 - File not found\n- Error code 6 - Permission denied\n- Error code 13 - Path/filename too long"}
