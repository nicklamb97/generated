For example:\n```\nloop1:     while condition1 do\n     /* statements */\n     loop2:     while condition2 do\n          if conditionA then\n               continue loop1;\n          endif;\n          /* Process row in the inner loop */\n   endwhile;\nendwhile;\n```\nIn this example, the labeled Continue Statement is used to skip the inner loop (loop2) and resume execution at the beginning of the outer loop (loop1).\n\n'

Here\'s an example:\n\n```\nfor i = 1 to x.LastRow do\n    if x[i]._ObjectType != "required" then\n        continue; // Skips the iteration if the current row doesn\'t represent a required object\n    endif;\n    /* Process the required object */\nendfor;\n```\n'

Provide an example scenario with code snippet.\n\n** Output\nUsing the Continue Statement in Actian 4GL can prove helpful in skipping the remainder of a loop iteration, especially when encountering unwanted data or specific conditions within the data. Here\'s an example demonstrating its usage:\n\nConsider a scenario where you want to process only rows with certain conditions and ignore other rows with different conditions. For example, you have a dataset with several rows, and you wish to find and process rows where the value in column \'status\' is equal to \'completed\'. You can use a Continue Statement as follows:\n\n```\nfor i = 1 to dataSet.RowCount do\n    if dataSet[i].status <> "completed" then\n        continue; // Skip this row iteration and move to the next one.\n    endif;\n    // Perform processing for rows where status is \'completed\'.\nendfor;\n```\n'

Discuss its importance and efficiency with examples.\n\n** Output\nUtilizing the Continue Statement in Actian 4GL offers numerous advantages that enhance program efficiency and readability. It enables you to effectively navigate through complex loops, especially when dealing with large datasets or iterating over specific conditions. Below is an example showcasing its significance:\n\nConsider a scenario where you need to filter out certain rows based on some criteria in a large dataset. Without using the Continue Statement, the entire loop would still iterate over each row, even those that do not meet your specified criteria. However, employing the Continue Statement allows you to quickly skip unwanted rows and move on to the next iteration where the criteria are met:\n\n```\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= x.LastRow do\n    if x[i].someCondition then\n        // Continue with the current loop iteration\n        continue;\n    endif;\n    // Perform processing for rows that meet specified condition.\n    i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\nIn this example, the Continue Statement ensures better performance as it saves computational resources by not processing unwanted rows. Additionally, it improves code readability by making it clear to others reading the code that specific conditions are being targeted and unwanted iterations skipped.\n\n'

Here's an example demonstrating this:\n\n```\ni = 1;\nwhile i <= x.LastRow do\n     if x[i]._SomeCondition is False then\n          // Skip the current row and move to the next one\n          continue;\n     endif;\n     /* Process row */\n     i = i + 1;\nendwhile;\n```\nIn this example, the 'Continue Statement' skips the iteration of rows where x[i]._SomeCondition is false.\n\n2. **Instruction**\nDescribe the use case for a labeled Continue Statement in Actian 4GL.\n\n**Input**\n<noinput>\n\n**Output**\nA labeled Continue Statement can be helpful when you have nested loops or multiple loops, allowing you to specify exactly which loop to continue with after skipping an iteration.

For instance, in a situation where you are iterating through a collection of items but want to skip items that do not meet specific criteria, using the continue statement is useful:\n   ```\n   i = 1;\n   while i <= x.LastRow do\n       if x[i]._RowState != RS_CHANGED then\n           i = i + 1;\n           continue;\n       endif;\n       /* Process row */\n       i = i + 1;\n   endwhile;\n   ```\n   In this example, the program skips rows (i) that are not changed.\n\n2. **Instruction**\nWhat happens when you use the Continue Statement without a specified label in Actian 4GL OpenROAD?\n   **Input**\n<noinput>\n   **Output**\nWhen using the Continue Statement without a specified label, OpenROAD (2.0) will continue with the innermost loop.

In this example, we have two loops: `loop1` and `loop2`. The `continue loop1` statement will skip the inner `loop2` when condition3 is true:\n   ```\n   loop1:     while condition1 do\n       /* statements */\n       loop2:     while condition2 do\n            /* statements */\n            if condition3 then\n                 continue loop1;\n            else\n                 continue loop2;\n            endif;\n       endwhile;\n   endwhile;\n   ```\n   In this case, using multiple labels makes the code clearer and easier to understand since it explicitly defines the loops being referred to in the Continue Statement.\n\n4. **Instruction**\nExplain how to process all changed rows in a table using Actian 4GL OpenROAD with the Continue Statement.

Rows with other states are skipped using the Continue Statement.\n\n5. **Instruction**\nSuppose you need to write an Actian 4GL OpenROAD function that determines whether a given integer is prime or not. Suggest how to use the Continue Statement in such a function, providing an example code snippet.\n   **Input**\n<noinput>\n   **Output**\nYou can write an Actian 4GL OpenROAD function to determine if a given number is prime or not using the Continue Statement like this:\n   ```\n   function IsPrime(n as integer): boolean;\n       i = 2;\n       if n <= 1 then\n           return false;\n       endif;\n       while i * i <= n do\n            if n % i == 0 then\n                continue;\n            endif;\n            i = i + 1;\n       endwhile;\n       return true;\n   endfunction;\n   ```\n   This function checks for divisibility starting from 2 and skips the remaining iterations of the loop if it finds a divisor using the Continue Statement.

Here's an example:\n\n```\nouterLoop: while condition1 do\n     /* statements */\n    innerLoop: while condition2 do\n         /* statements */\n         if someCondition then\n             continue outerLoop; // Continues with the outer loop when a specific condition is true\n         else\n             continue innerLoop; // Continues with the inner loop otherwise\n         endif;\n   endwhile;\nendwhile;\n```\nIn this example, the continue statements can choose between continuing with either the outer or inner loop based on whether someCondition is true or false. If someCondition is true, the outer loop continues execution from its next iteration. Otherwise, the inner loop will resume its execution from the next iteration.\n\n"

This is useful when you want to skip some iterations based on certain conditions within your loops.\n'

Provide an example if possible.\n** Output\nIn Actian 4GL OpenROAD, you can use the Continue Statement in For loops as well. The syntax remains the same for all loop types:\n```\ncontinue [label];\n```\nHere's an example of using a Continue Statement within a For Loop:\n```\nFor i = 1 To x.LastRow do\n    If x[i]._RowState != RS_CHANGED then\n        continue;\n    endif;\n    /* Process row */\nEnd for;\n```\nIn this example, the Continue Statement is used to skip the current iteration if the row state is not changed. The program continues processing the next row when the row state is changed.\n"

Here's an example:\n```\nlabel1:\n    i = 0;\n    while condition do\n        i = i + 1;\n        If i > 5 then\n            continue label1;\n        endif;\n        /* Process row */\n    End while;\n```\nIn this example, the Continue Statement is used with a label to skip the current iteration if `i` is greater than 5 and return to the start of the loop at label1. The program continues processing the next row when `i` is less than or equal to 5.\n"
