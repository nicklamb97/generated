In other words, the invalid user identifier will be ignored and only the valid users will be added to the group. For example:\n```sql\ncreate group tel_sales with users = (harryk, joanb, inv_invalid);\n```\nIn this case, the user "inv\\_invalid" is an invalid user identifier so it will be ignored and the users "harryk" and "joanb" will be added to the group "tel\\_sales".\n'

2024-07-18T18:44:03 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of the users parameter in the create group statement?\n** Output\nThe `users` parameter specifies the list of user IDs that are part of a group. The user IDs can be separated by commas, and they allow the database administrator (or another user with the proper security privilege) to grant identical privileges to multiple users at once.\n\n'

To execute a `create group` statement in SQL Actian 4GL, you must have the `MAINTAIN_USERS` privilege and be connected to the `iidbdb` database. This is necessary for creating new groups, which involves managing user identifiers.\n"
2024-07-18T18:50:37 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\n** Instruction\nWhat is the purpose of creating a group identifier in SQL Actian 4GL?\n\n** Output\nThe purpose of creating a group identifier in SQL Actian 4GL is to establish a unique identifier for a group of users and to associate them with it. This allows database administrators (or users with specific privileges) to grant identical privileges to a group of users. When a member of the group begins a session, they can specify the group identifier in the SQL or connect statement (or on the operating system command line using the `-G` flag) to obtain the privileges associated with the group.\n\n'
2024-07-18T18:50:37 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): "\n\n<|assistant|>\n** Instruction\nWhat is the role of a group identifier in SQL Actian 4GL?\n\n** Output\nA group identifier plays an essential role in SQL Actian 4GL by providing a way to group multiple users together and managing their privileges. When you create a group identifier, you assign it a unique name that doesn't already exist within the database. You can then associate specific users with this group identifier, allowing database administrators or other authorized individuals to grant identical privileges to all members of the group. This simplifies the process of managing access rights for multiple users, making it more efficient and less error-prone.\n\n"

And how do users obtain the privileges associated with their respective groups?\n<|assistant|>\nTo associate privileges with a group, you need to create or modify user accounts with the proper privileges and then add them as members of the group using the `create group` statement. Once a member of the group begins a session, they can obtain the privileges associated with the group by specifying the group identifier in the `sql` or `connect` statement (or on the operating system command line, using the `-G` flag).\n'
2024-07-18T19:01:07 - Discarded instruction(didn't match expected format): '\nWhat are the conditions for creating a group identifier using create group statement in SQL Actian 4GL?\n** Output\nTo create a group identifier with the `create group` statement, you need to provide a unique group_id (group identifier) that follows the naming rules for valid object names. Optionally, you can also specify users to be members of the group by using the `with users` clause and providing the list of user_ids separated by commas.\n'

It enables the database administrator or user that has the security privilege to grant identical privileges to a group of users easily. When a member of the group begins a session, they can specify the group identifier in the `sql` or `connect` statement (or on the operating system command line) to obtain the privileges associated with the group.\n'
