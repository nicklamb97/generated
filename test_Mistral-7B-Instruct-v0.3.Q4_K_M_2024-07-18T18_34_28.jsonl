Indexes can be unique or non-unique and use storage structures\nlike BTREE, ISAM, HASH, or RTREE.\n"}

Optional clauses like `with` can specify additional\nparameters such as storage structure (`structure`) and key columns (`key`).\n"}

These parameters define the name, table, columns, storage structure, and additional\nsettings for the index creation.\n"}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "What permissions are required to execute the create index statement?", "assistant": "To execute the create index statement, the user must be the owner of the table where the index is being created.\nSpecial permissions are required to create indexes on system tables or when using specific index options.\n"}
{"system": "You are an AI language model developed by IBM Research. You are a cautious assistant. You carefully follow instructions. You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "How does the create index statement affect database locking?", "assistant": "Creating an index on a table requires an exclusive lock on the table, preventing other sessions from accessing\nthe table until the index creation is complete. This ensures data integrity during the indexing process.\n"}
